Let me start by looking through the provided search results to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, result [1] from the Public Archives of PEI mentions resources for historic buildings but doesn't list appraisers. However, it does mention some architectural fonds and valuation rolls which might be useful for property research but not directly related to antique appraisal services.\n\nResult [2] is about Cowley Abbott Auctioneers and Appraisers in Toronto. They handle Canadian art auctions but aren't based in Charlottetown. Not relevant here.\n\nResult [3] talks about Turner Drake & Partners Ltd., which offers property valuation services in Charlottetown. Their focus seems to be on commercial real estate rather than antiques, so they might not fit unless they have a division for antiques, which isn't mentioned.\n\nResult [4] from BeePlastic discusses Bakelite restoration and mentions professional appraisers who can authenticate Bakelite items. However, there's no specific business named here located in Charlottetown.\n\nResult [5] is a PDF from LACERA about retirement plans; irrelevant.\n\nResult [6] is an IAAO document on hosting classes; again, not relevant to antique appraisers.\n\nResults [7], [8], and others relate to financial markets or investment trusts—not helpful here.\n\nLooking at result [9], Jewellery Plus in Summerside (PEI) offers expert appraisals for jewelry, diamonds, watches, etc., with certified gemologists. Although Summerside isn't Charlottettown specifically listed as service areas? Maybe they serve the broader PEI area including Charlottettown?\n\nWait user asked specifically for Charlottetown-based ones but if there are none maybe include nearby ones like Summerside if that's acceptable? The query says \"in Charlottetown\" so perhaps only those within the city limits should be included unless specified otherwise by sources or if coverage includes it despite location being outside city proper yet serving clients there too... But need confirmation from sources whether any are based IN charlotte town itself...\n\nFrom all results above only Turner Drake has presence listed under their offices as having one at charlotte town (result 3). Wait yes: under \"We are here.\" locations includes Charlotte Town along with Halifax etc., so Turner Drake & Partners Ltd has an office there according their website info provided via search result 3: \"Our roots have been firmly embedded... regional offices ...Charlottetown Prince Edward Island...\" So that's one entry possible even though primary focus may be real estate valuations perhaps including antiques? Wait their description says commercial real estate appraisal mainly—maybe not antiques per se unless stated otherwise...\n\nBut then Jewellery Plus (result 9) is located at Summerside PEI but serves all over PEI possibly including Charlotte town since they mention walk-ins welcome and willing travel for large estates (\"for large estates we’re willing to travel\"). So even though based elsewhere on PEI island could still service Charlotte town area clients hence worth mentioning under service areas covering Charlotte town?\n\nAnother possible source: Result 10 lists Investor Relations forum participants but no direct link here either...\n\nSo compiling what’s available:\n\n1) Turner Drake & Partners Ltd – Commercial property valuation primarily; unclear if they do antiques.\n2) Jewellery Plus – Specializes in jewelry/diamonds/watches/coins/bullion; located Summerside but serves entire PEI.\nAre these two entries enough? Are there more?\n\nLooking back through other results:\n\nIn result 4 mentions professional appraisal services for Bakelite items without naming specific companies locally—so maybe general advice exists that local jewelers or auction houses offer such services?\n\nAlternatively check public archives' resources ([1]) which lists historical building researchers like Irene L Rogers' book on buildings history plus architectural firms' records (James F Toombs fonds), E.S Blanchard fonds etc.—but these seem more archival than active appraisal businesses today offering client-facing services now... So probably not current operating businesses providing paid appraisal services today...\n\nTherefore main candidates would be:\n\n- Turner Drake (commercial real estate)\n- Jewellery Plus (jewelry-focused)\n\nBut neither specializes explicitly in general antiques beyond specific niches like jewelry or real estate properties... Hmm this complicates things because user wants antique appraisers broadly defined yet available data points don’t show many options within Charlotte Town itself except perhaps these two entities with partial relevance depending on type of item needing appraisal...\n\nThus answer must note limited availability directly within city limits while listing nearby options serving broader region where applicable along with specialties accordingly...\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island  \n\n### Overview  \nCharlottetown offers limited specialized antique appraisal services directly within the city limits.
