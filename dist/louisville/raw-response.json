      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Louisville, Kentucky based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned as offering antique appraisals with in-person, remote, and photo-based options. They have certified appraisers from ISA and ASA. Their contact info is 400 S 2nd St, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 1-844-378-7253. They mention specialties like fine art, furniture, jewelry.\n\nSource [5] also talks about Prestige Estate Services in Louisville again. It adds that they do IRS estate tax appraisals and have expertise in sculptures and decorative arts. Same address and phone number here.\n\nSource [6] mentions Howard & Thomas Auction House located at 945 E Breckinridge St (warehouse). They offer USPAP-compliant appraisals for antiques and collectibles. Contact is Peter Ashby Howard or Barry Thomas at 502-717-4312. Their specialties include fine art and antique furniture auctions.\n\nSource [7] lists some antique shops but doesn't directly mention appraisal services except maybe dealers who could offer valuations indirectly? Not sure if that's relevant here since the query specifically asks for appraisers.\n\nSource [9] is The Leake Co., but they're in Salt Lake City according to URL‚Äîso probably not relevant for Louisville directory despite being an appraisal service.\n\nSources [2], [3], [4], etc., don't seem to provide info specific to Louisville antique appraisers except maybe Adams Appraisal LLC from source[2]. Wait: Adams Appraisal LLC's URL says Chicago but their content mentions USPAP compliance via ISA certifications which might be applicable if they serve Louisville? Wait no‚Äîsource[2] URL says adamsappraisalllc.com/whats-new/ which mentions Chicago location so probably not serving Kentucky unless stated otherwise; need to check content again: \"Adams Appraisal Chicago | Art Antiques Collectables\" so likely based in Chicago‚Äîso exclude them from Louisville list unless there's a branch there which isn't mentioned here.\n\nLooking back at sources:\n\nOnly sources directly mentioning Louisville are:\n\n1) Prestige Estate Services ([1], [5])\n\n6) Howard & Thomas Auction House ([6])\n\n10) PBS Roadshow example has Harvey Joiner painting evaluated but that‚Äôs just an example of an appraisal story set elsewhere (Cincinnati).\n\nSo compiling entries for these two main companies: Prestige Estate Services and Howard & Thomas Auction House.\n\nFor each entry:\n\nName/Business Details: Names as per sources; addresses from their respective pages (Prestige has multiple locations including the one listed on their site).\n\nSpecialties/Expertise: For Prestige it‚Äôs antiques like art, furniture jewelry; Howard & Thomas focuses on auction items including antiques/fine art/furniture etc., plus USPAP compliance noted in source[6].\n\nContact Info: Phone numbers given as above.\n\nYears in Business: Not explicitly stated anywhere except perhaps \"over 25 years\" mentioned by Clark‚Äôs Carmel Stone (source[4]), but that seems unrelated. Maybe need to omit years if not available?\n\nCertifications: ISA/ASA for Prestige; USPAP compliant for Howard & Thomas via LiveAuctioneers profile (source[6]).\n\nService Areas/Pricing:\n\nFrom source[3]: HomeAdvisor gives general home appraisal costs ($300-$400 avg), but this might be more real estate related though includes personal property? But the query is about antiques specifically so maybe different pricing structures noted elsewhere?\n\nIn source[1]/Prestige Estates' FAQ section says costs vary by type (in-person vs remote), complexity‚Äîbut no exact figures given beyond competitive pricing upon quote request. Similarly other sources may not specify exact prices except perhaps The Leake Co.'s jewelry appraisal fees ($125 first item), but they're out of state so irrelevant here.\n\n\nThus under service areas/pricing sections I can note typical ranges based on general data where possible or state that quotes are provided upon consultation when specifics aren't available.\n\n\nBusiness Hours would require checking each company's website details which aren‚Äôt fully present here except possibly contact pages suggesting standard business hours without specifics.\n\n\nPutting it all together into concise entries with subsections as per user request.\n</think>\n\nHere‚Äôs a concise directory of professional antique appraisers serving **Louisville**, **Kentucky**:\n\n---\n\n## **Overview of Antique Appraisal Services**  \nLouisville offers specialized services through credentialed experts focusing on insurance valuation, estate planning/resale guidance, IRS compliance reports (**USPAP standards**), market analysis via historical sales data comparisons ([1][5][6]).
