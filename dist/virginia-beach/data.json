      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Let me start by going through the provided search results to find relevant information. \n\nFirst, looking at the sources, several mention Prestige Estate Services and their appraisers like Erika Holycross and Alicia E. Weaver. Source [2] talks about Erika Holycross being an expert appraiser with Prestige Estate Services, and source [9] provides details on Alicia Weaver from the same company. Both are certified with ISA and USPAP. They cover specialties like fine art, antiques, furniture.\n\nSource [3] also mentions Prestige Estate Services offering antique appraisals with various options (in-person, remote). Their service areas include multiple states but specifically mention Virginia locations in source [6], which is AppraiseItNow operating in Virginia with online services.\n\nSource [5] discusses Busby Antiques offering in-home appraisals but they're based in Florida; not relevant for Virginia Beach. Source [10] mentions Barrett Street Auction Center & Antique Mall in Virginia—checking that: it's an auction house with over 40 years in business but located at 5401 Barretts Rd., Newport News—close to Virginia Beach? Need to confirm if Newport News is part of the service area for VA Beach.\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor (source[4]) talk about general appraisal costs but not specific businesses in VA Beach. The Englewood Chamber PDF (source[8]) doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nSo compiling from sources:\n\n1. Prestige Estate Services has multiple appraisers (Erika Holycross, Alicia Weaver) operating nationally including VA.\n2. AppraiseItNow offers online services covering VA.\n3. Barrett Street Auction Center might be nearby but located in Newport News—should include if they serve VA Beach area.\n4.Check if there are other local businesses mentioned elsewhere?\n\nLooking for contact info: \n- Prestige's website (sources[1][2][3][7][9]) lists contact as info@prestigestateservices.com or 303-449-0409.\n- AppraiseItNow (source[6]) has website contact.\n- Barrett Street Auction Center (source[10]) phone is 757-599-3328.\n\nSpecialties: \nPrestige covers antiques, art; AppraiseItNow does various assets; Barrett Street focuses on auctions/appraisals as part of their mall.\n\nCertifications: ISA CAPP for Alicia Weaver; USPAP compliance mentioned for both Prestige and AppraiseItNow.\n\nYears in business: \nBarrett Street has over 40 years; Prestige's team members have decades of experience per source[9].\n\nService areas:\nPrestige serves nationwide including VA locations; AppraiseItNow covers all of VA online; Barrett St is local to Newport News possibly serving nearby cities like VB?\n\nPricing:\nFrom source[2], non-regulated $175/hr IRS $225/hr from Prestige.Appraiseitnow’s pricing isn't detailed here except expedited fees possible.Barrett St may charge via auction commissions or hourly rates?\n\nBusiness hours need inference since not explicitly stated except maybe general office hours or by appointment only noted from some sources.\n\nNeed to structure each section as per query requirements:\n\nOverview first listing key points about services available then list each appraiser found with their details.Since only a few are directly mentioned related to VA beach,I'll note those plus any others inferred from coverage areas.Make sure all data points are covered concisely without markdown formatting errors.Citations should be properly placed after each fact using the search result numbers provided.\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of antique appraisal services and professionals serving **Virginia Beach**, based on available data:\n\n---\n\n### **Overview**  \nAntique appraisal services near Virginia Beach include national firms offering remote/in-person evaluations alongside specialized local experts focusing on furniture, fine art, collectibles, and estate valuations ([1][3]).
