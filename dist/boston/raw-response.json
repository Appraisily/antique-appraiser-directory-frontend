Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and their details.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Doyle Auctions (Results 1 and 9):** They have a Boston/New England location with specialists like Kathryn Craig and Chris Barber. They handle Chinese porcelain, jewelry, art, etc., with notable sales like the Morrill Collection. Contact info is available.\n\n2. **Prestige Estate Services (Results 2,3,5,7):** Mentioned multiple times as ISA-certified appraisers specializing in antiques like steamer trunks. Their Boston team includes Edward Kitson and others. Services include insurance, estate tax appraisals with USPAP compliance. Address in Tremont St., contact number provided.\n\n3. **Manzi Appraisers (Result 10):** Based in Woburn but serves Boston area since it's nearby (Woburn is part of Greater Boston). Offers USPAP-compliant appraisals for art and antiques; contact info listed.\n\n4. **Gurr Johns (Result 6):** Global firm with USPAP compliance; they do tax/estate planning but not explicitly mentioned as based in Boston though they operate there given their global network.\n\n5. **Ellen Amirkhan via ARCS (Result 4):** Certified Rug Specialist from Dallas but consults nationally; might be relevant for rugs in Boston? Not sure if local enough—maybe mention under specialties?\n\nOther sources: Result 8 is about home comps—not relevant here; result4 also mentions Chuck Koshgarian Rug Cleaning but unclear if he does appraisals.\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\nFor each appraiser:\n- Name/Business: Check names from Prestige Estate Services (Edward Kitson team), Doyle's Kathryn Craig/Chris Barber.\n- Specialties: Doyle has Chinese porcelain & fine art; Prestige covers general antiques including steamer trunks; Manzi does art/furniture.\n- Certifications: ISA/USPAP for Prestige and Manzi.\n- Years: Doyle since 1962 mentioned in result9.\n- Contact info: Addresses from Prestige [7], Doyle [1], Manzi [10].\n- Service areas: All serve Greater Boston per their pages.\n- Pricing: Only result3 mentions varying costs based on appraisal type—note that typical pricing isn't explicit but can state \"varies by service.\"\n\nNeed to structure sections as per query:\n1 Overview\n2 List of Appraisers\n3 Service Areas/Pricing\n4 Contact/Hours\n\nCheck for missing data points like business hours—most don’t list hours except maybe phone numbers or addresses where one could infer standard business hours unless specified otherwise.\n\nNotable certifications should include ISA membership for Prestige and Gurr Johns' USPAP compliance.\n\nEnsure all entries are concise without fluff while covering required elements.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Boston  \n\n### Overview  \nBoston’s antique appraisal sector combines historic expertise with modern market insights, offering services ranging from estate valuations to specialized assessments for insurance or IRS purposes ([7][5]).
