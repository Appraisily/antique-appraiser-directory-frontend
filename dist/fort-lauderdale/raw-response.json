      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at [1], Koosh Jewelers mentions estate buyers with licensed appraisers for antiques, jewelry, and coins. Their contact info is there and they've been around over 30 years. They should be included.\n\nSource [2] talks about Lluria Fine Arts in Miami with Juan P. Lluria, a certified AAA member specializing in fine art and antiques. Even though it's Miami-based, since the service area might cover nearby regions like Fort Lauderdale, maybe include them but note the location.\n\n[3] and [4] both refer to Lion & Unicorn Auction House in Hollywood, FL (South Florida). They offer estate sales and appraisals with over 30 years experience. Their contact details are listed; Hollywood is close to Fort Lauderdale so service area likely includes it.\n\n[6] is Moecker Auctions in Fort Lauderdale itself. They do asset appraisals including antiques and have been around over two decades. Definitely include them as local.\n\n[7] mentions Craig at Fort Lauderdale Antique Store (Decorative Arts & Fine Antiques) with positive reviews highlighting expertise in furniture and decorative items. The business name isn't explicitly stated but can infer from URL: \"Fort Lauderdale Antique Store Decorative Arts & Fine Antiques\". Contact info might be from the reviews or website?\n\n[8] Global Jewelers (Gold Buyers of Broward) focuses on jewelry but mentions estate jewelry appraisal; maybe list under specialties if they handle antique jewelry.\n\n[10] Coinfully deals with coins but offers free appraisals; could mention under coin specialists even though not strictly antiques beyond coins.\n\nOther sources like [5], [9], etc., don't seem directly relevant as they discuss real estate or Salt Lake City services.\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\n1. **Koosh Jewelers**: Estate Buyers section notes their 30+ years, specialties in antiques/jewelry/coins.\n2. **Lluria Fine Arts**: Juan P Lluria has AAA certification for general residential contents including art/antiques.\n3. **Lion & Unicorn**: Hollywood-based but serves South FL including FtL.\n4.**Moecker Auctions**: Local FtL auction house with asset appraisal services for 20+ years.\n5.**Fort Lauderdale Antique Store (Decorative Arts & Fine Antiques)**: Craig's shop mentioned as reputable for furniture/decorative arts.\n6.**Global Jewelers/Gold Buyers of Broward**: Specialize in jewelry but part of estates.\n7.**Coinfully Florida**: Coin specialists offering free appraisals; located online/Florida-wide?\n\nService areas: Most are South Florida or specifically FtL except Lluria which is Miami-based but may serve wider areas.\n\nPricing: Sources mention hourly rates ([2]), percentage fees ([5]), or free consultations ([10]). Need to note where possible without guesswork—only explicit pricing info found was from Lion & Unicorn charging hourly plus travel if needed ([4]).\n\nCertifications: AAA for Lluria ([2]), others may have certifications not specified except Moecker being licensed/bonded ([6]).\n\nContact info: Extract emails/phones from each source where available (e.g., Lion has sales@lionandunicorn.com).\n\nBusiness hours: Koosh doesn't specify hours; Lion says Mon-Fri 10-5 EST; Moecker likely standard business hours too?\n\nNeed to structure this into sections per user request:\n\n1 Overview first summarizing key points about services available—appraisal types offered by different firms (art/furniture/jewelry/coins), range of experience/certifications/pricing models etc.)\n\nThen list each appraiser with their details based on extracted data above ensuring all required fields are covered as much as possible given available info from sources without making up missing data points like exact pricing if not provided.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Fort Lauderdale  \n\n### Overview  \nFort Lauderdale offers diverse antique appraisal services specializing in fine art, furniture, jewelry, coins, and collectibles.
