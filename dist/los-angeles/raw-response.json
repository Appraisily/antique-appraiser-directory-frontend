      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Los Angeles based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and their information.\n\nFirst, looking at [1], Amanda McConaha is mentioned as a fine art appraiser in Los Angeles. She specializes in Post-War, Contemporary, and Emerging Fine Art. Her certifications include the Certified Appraisers Association of America and USPAP compliance. She's been active for nearly two decades. Contact info: +1 213-883-7033, address in LA.\n\nSource [4] talks about Jaime A. Corbacho from ISA with nearly 20 years of experience. She handles antiques, decorative arts, furniture, memorabilia. Her contact is (617) 775-1691 in LA 90025. Certifications include ISA Accredited Member and USPAP.\n\nSource [6] mentions the Appraisers Association of America with over 900 members but doesn't list specific names beyond Anderson Fine Art Appraisals which might be part of their network? Not sure if Anderson is an individual or company here; maybe need to check but since it's not detailed elsewhere, perhaps just mention the association as a resource.\n\nSource [8] refers to Clars Auctions offering appraisal services including antiques and collectibles but they're based in the Bay Area—so maybe service area includes LA? The page says \"Bay Area and beyond,\" so possibly include them noting their broader service area.\n\nSource [9] mentions Ellen Amirkhan as a Certified Appraiser of Oriental Rugs (ISA/ORRA) associated with ARCS events in Dallas but she consults nationally; her contact isn't listed here except through ARCS email: info@rugcarespecialists.org.\n\nKash Sobhe from Rug Ideas ([9]) is a Certified Master Rug Cleaner in LA specializing in oriental rugs—maybe relevant for rug appraisals?\n\nReilly Clark ([10]) is based in Santa Barbara but serves Southern California including LA; specialties are fine art appraisals with ISA/ASA certifications.\n\nNow compiling all these into sections:\n\n1. **Overview**: Antique appraisal services cover various specialties like furniture, decorative arts, oriental rugs etc., certified by bodies like AAA, ISA etc., serving insurance estates etc.\n2.**Appraiser List**:\n   - Amanda McConaha\n   - Jaime Corbacho\n   - Ellen Amirkhan (oriental rugs)\n   - Kash Sobhe (rugs)\n   - Reilly Clark (though Santa Barbara-based)\n3.**Service Areas**: Mostly LA metro; some may serve wider SoCal.\n4.**Pricing**: From source [3], home appraisals average $357 but personal property varies—might need to note that pricing depends on item type/complexity.\n5.**Contact Info/Business Hours**: Include phone numbers where available; business hours not specified except Clars Auctions' upcoming events which aren't hours per se—probably state \"varies by appraiser.\"\n\nNeed to verify if all mentioned are indeed antique-specific or if some focus more on fine art vs antiques e.g., Amanda McConaha does Post-War/Contemporary which might overlap less with traditional antiques? But her profile also mentions artist estates so maybe still applicable for antique contexts depending on era covered.Jaime Corbacho explicitly lists antiques/decorative arts.Ellen Amirkhan/Kash Sobhe are rug specialists.Reilly Clark does antiquities so that's relevant.Source[7] Prestige Estate Services does government assets which may not fit unless they handle private antiques too—their page says personal property valuation including art/antiquities so could be included under corporate services perhaps?\n\nWait user query asks specifically for antique appraisers directory.Prestige Estate Services ([7]) offers government asset appraisal including personal property like art/antiquities.Maybe mention them under corporate or specialized services section?\n\nClars Auctions ([8]) provides valuations for trusts & estates/museums.They’re auction house offering appraisal services.Since they’re located Bay Area but serve beyond that could list them noting coverage includes LA area.Similarly Reilly Clark covers SoCal from Santa Barbara.Include those who service even if HQ elsewhere?\n\nAlso check sources again:\n\n[6]: Anderson Fine Art Appraisal via AAA.Link leads to generic AAA page mentioning members specialize across areas.Perhaps suggest checking AAA directory since specific names aren’t given apart from Amanda already listed via J.S.Held([1]).\n\nSo final list would be:\n\nAmanda McConaha\n\nJaime A.Corbacho\n\nEllen Amirkhan\n\nKash Sobhe\n\nReilly Clark\n\nClars Auctions \n\nPrestige Estate Services \n\nPossibly others from associations like AAA where individuals can be found via directories.Not enough data here though.Stick strictly to provided sources unless instructed otherwise.User said use search results only.I think that's covered above.Now structure answer per format rules: start with summary then sections using headers.## Overview,## Directory Listings,## Service Areas/Pricing,## Contact Info/Hours.Avoid bullet points when possible.Use tables where comparing features.But since it's listings better as subsections under each name.Make sure citations match correctly after sentences.E.g.Amanda cited from[1],Jaime[4],Ellen&Kash[9],Reilly[10],Clars[8].Check each detail against sources.\n</think>\n\nLos Angeles offers a robust network of professional antique appraisers specializing in diverse categories such as furniture, decorative arts, oriental rugs, and fine art collections.
