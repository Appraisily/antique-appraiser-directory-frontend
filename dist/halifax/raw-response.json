      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Halifax, Nova Scotia based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each search result to identify relevant appraisers and their information.\n\nFirst, looking at result [1], Finer Things Antiques & Curios offers appraisal services with an accredited member of the Canadian Professional Appraisers. They have over 20 years in business, specialize in antiques and collectibles, and their pricing is $100 per hour. Contact info is there too.\n\nResult [2] mentions Harrington's Auctioneers & Appraisers having an event in Dartmouth. But since the user asked for Halifax, maybe they also operate there? Wait, result [6] is another event by Harrington's in Halifax itself on March 13-14, 2025. They offer evaluations for jewellery and timepieces but might do antiques too as part of auctions. Their contact info is via Eventbrite or phone.\n\nResult [5] talks about La Mine d'Or Jewellers focusing on jewellery appraisals with Lawrence Hartnett. Since they're specialists in jewellery, maybe include them under a specialty section? Similarly, result [8] from Dorothée Rosen Designer Goldsmith also does jewellery appraisals with certifications like CJA CAP.\n\nResult [3] is Kempton Appraisals which does property valuations (residential/commercial), not antiques directly. So probably exclude unless antique properties are involved? The query specifies antique appraisers so maybe leave them out unless needed for broader context.\n\nResult [9] mentions Bay Appraisals Jewelry but they're based in El Paso; not relevant here except as an example of appraisal processes but not local to Halifax.\n\nNow compiling all antique-specific services:\n\n1. Finer Things Antiques & Curios (from result [1]) – clear fit.\n2. Harrington's Auctioneers & Appraisers (results [2][6]) – handle antiques through auctions.\n3. La Mine d'Or Jewellers (result[5]) – jewellery-specific.\n4.Dorothée Rosen (result[8]) – jewellery again.\n  \nSo main antique appraiser would be Finer Things and Harrington's perhaps?\n\nWait check if others mention antiques: Result[9] has Titanic jewels but that’s historical rather than local services.\n\nSo overview should mention types like general antiques vs specialized (jewellery). Then list each business with details from their respective results:\n\nFiner Things:\n- Name: Finer Things Antiques & Curios\n- Address: 6438 Quinpool Road\n- Contact: Phone/email\n- Years: Over 20 years\n- Certifications: Canadian Professional Appraiser member; CADA/CAPPA memberships.\n- Specialties: Antique furniture/collectibles; insurance/replacement value.\n- Pricing:$100/hour including travel time.\n\nHarrington’s:\nFrom results[2][6], events but regular services?\nTheir website says auctioneering so likely handle estate sales etc., offering written appraisals via third-party per result[6]. Need to note specialties as fine art/jewellery/coins etc., certifications ISA/USPAP standards via partners?\n\nLa Mine d'Or:\nSpecializes only in jewellery; Lawrence Hartnett has GIA/CJA CAP certs.$120 per piece.[result5]\n\nDorothée Rosen:\nJewellery again,Certified CJA CAP,$120 + tax per piece.[result8]\n\nService areas would be HRM for most; pricing varies by type ($100/hr vs flat rate).\n\nBusiness hours need checking—only some provide hours.Finer Things may have store hours.Harrington’s events are specific dates.La Mine d'Or has clinics every other Thursday.Dorothée requires drop-off appointments.So list available hours where possible or note \"by appointment\".\n\nNotable certifications:CAPPA,CADACJA CAP,GIA Graduate Gemologist etc.\n\nPutting it all together into sections as requested:\n\nOverview first mentioning generalists vs specialists like jewellers.List each appraiser under section 2 with required details.Service areas HRM.Pricing ranges.Contact info from sources.Cite sources appropriately without references section.\n</think>\n\nHalifax offers diverse antique appraisal services through established businesses specializing in general collectibles and niche areas like jewelry:\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Services Overview**  \nHalifax provides professional appraisal services covering furniture, art, jewelry, coins/banknotes (**$100–$150/hour** or **flat fees**).
