      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania based on the provided search results. Let me start by reviewing the search results to identify relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at result [1], William Bunch Auctions & Appraisals is located in Chadds Ford, PA. Although Chadds Ford is near Philadelphia, it's not within the city itself. However, they might service Philadelphia as part of their area. They have specialties like 18th-20th century furniture, porcelain, art glass, and more. Their contact info is 610-558-1800.\n\nResult [3] mentions Erika Holycross from Prestige Estate Services. She's an ISA member and USPAP-compliant appraiser specializing in fine art and antiques. The website (prestigeestateservices.com) lists their services as insurance appraisals and estate planning with contact info 1-844-ITEM-VAL.\n\nResult [7] specifically talks about Prestige Estate Services in Philadelphia offering personal property appraisals including antiques. They list team members like Edward Kitson and Stephanie Calman but don't provide individual details beyond that page mentioning they are ISA members and IRS-qualified.\n\nResult [8] from Prestige Estate Services again highlights their team's expertise with certifications like ISA membership and USPAP compliance but doesn't add new names beyond Erika Holycross mentioned earlier.\n\nOther results mention Prestige Estate Services multiple times across different pages ([2], [6], [10]), emphasizing their services include antique appraisals with remote options but focus on general info rather than specific Philly-based appraisers except for result [7].\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. **William Bunch Auctions & Appraisals** - Located nearby but services Philly? Need to check if they cover Philadelphia area.\n2. **Prestige Estate Services** - Based in Philly with multiple specialists (Erika Holycross mentioned elsewhere). Their page lists Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman as team members.\n3. **Ellen Amirkhan** from result [9] has a CRS certification but works in Dallas; not relevant here.\n4 Result[4] PBS Antiques Roadshow isn't an appraisal service provider directly.\n5 Result[5] is about religious archives toolkit‚Äînot relevant.\n\nSo main entries are William Bunch (if serving Philly) and Prestige Estate Services' team members plus any others found?\n\nWait result[7]: \"Philadelphia Personal Property Appraisal Types\" includes Comprehensive estate tax appraisals etc., so definitely operating there.\n\nAlso checking service areas: From result[6], \"Nationwide Coverage\" including PA locations; however result[7] specifically mentions serving Philadelphia with local experts.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nOverview: Antique appraisal services in Philly include specialists offering various valuations for insurance estates etc., certified through ISA/USPAP/ASA etc.\n\n\nAppraiser List:\n\n1.Prestige Estate Services Team (Edward Kitson et al.)\n2.William Bunch Auctions & Appraisals (if they serve Philly)\nOthers? Any other names?\n\nLooking back at all results only these two entities come up directly related to antique appraisal near or within Philadelphia.\n\n\nFor each entry:\n\nName/Business: For example:\n-Prestige Estate Services\nAddresses/contact from their websites:\nFrom result[7]: Contact via phone 1-844-ITEM-VAL or email given there.\n\n\nSpecialties should be pulled from each source‚ÄîWilliam Bunch has a long list including furniture porcelain etc., while Prestige covers fine art antiques collectibles.\n\n\nCertifications: ISA membership for both? William Bunch states compliance with USPAP standards; Prestige mentions ISA ASA certifications.\n\n\nYears in business not explicitly stated except William Bunch has reviews since 869 which might indicate longevity but unclear exact years.\n\n\nService areas: Both likely cover greater Philly region\n\n\nPricing: From result[8], $175-$225 per hour depending on type; also free photo valuations available via some sources\n\n\nBusiness hours aren‚Äôt listed explicitly so maybe omit unless inferred as standard business hours\n\n\nNeed to structure this concisely per query requirements ensuring all points covered without redundancy.\n</think>\n\nPhiladelphia offers access to qualified antique appraisal professionals through established firms specializing in diverse valuation needs:\n\n---\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Firms Directory**\n\n### **1\\.
