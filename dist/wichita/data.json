      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Wichita, Kansas based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Art of Estates is mentioned with locations including Wichita. They have appraisers like Brady Dreasher and Denice S. Morris listed in source [3]. Both have certifications like ISA CAPP and ASA. Their specialties include fine art, antiques, and collectibles.\n\nSource [5] mentions Jewelry Savers in Wichita offering jewelry appraisals. They've been around since 1971, so that's over 50 years. Contact info is provided there too.\n\nSource [7] talks about A-OK Pawn & Jewelry in Wichita offering tool appraisals. While tools might be a stretch for antiques, they do mention \"general line antiques\" which could be relevant.\n\nSource [9] lists dealers at the Tulsa Antique Show, including Charley Tucker from Men With Wood in Wichita under general line antiques and Rick Turpin also from Wichita with general line antiques. However, these are dealers; not sure if they offer appraisal services directly.\n\nOther sources like [2], [4], [6], [8], and others don't seem to mention Wichita antique appraisers specifically or are unrelated (like obituaries or government reports).\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. **Art of Estates** has multiple certified appraisers (Brady Dreasher with ISA CAPP etc., Denice S Morris ASA). Their specialties cover a wide range as per source[1]. Contact info would be their website/phone from source[1].\n\n2. **Jewelry Savers** focuses on jewelry but could handle antique jewelry given their expertise since 1971 (source[5]).\n\n3. **A-OK Pawn & Jewelry** does tool appraisals but maybe other items? The query specifies antique so maybe include them but note their specialty is tools/pawn items.\n\n4.**The Golden Rule Jewelry** (Danessa Stewart) from source[3] is based in Wichita but specializes in jewelry—might fit under antique jewelry appraisal?\n\nWait Danessa Stewart's business is The Golden Rule Jewelry LLC mentioned in source[3]. She's a second-gen jeweler with GIA training; likely does appraisals for jewelry which can include antique pieces.\n\nAlso Woody Auction (Jason Woody) operates auctions which sometimes involve appraisal services? Source[3] mentions Jason Woody as an auctioneer but not explicitly as an appraiser—maybe not directly applicable unless they offer appraisal services pre-auction.\n\nNeed to check each entry carefully:\n\nFrom source[3]:\n\n- Brady Dreasher (Art of Estates): ISA CAPP etc., works for Art of Estates.\n- Denice S Morris (Art of Estates): ASA certified.\n- Danessa Stewart: The Golden Rule Jewelry—jewelry-specific.\n- Mark Buckley: Toy Depot—toys specifically.\n- Lancy Fry: Coins & Precious Metals.\n  \nSo only Art of Estates staff are explicitly listed as accredited personal property appraisers suitable for various categories beyond just their niche like toys or coins.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAppraisal firms/directories:\n\nArt of Estates covers multiple specialties with certifications; contact via their site/phone listed probably same as parent company details from sources[1][3].\n\nJewelry Savers handles jewelry including antiques; contact info from source[5].\n\nA-OK Pawn & Jewelry might do some general items but more focused on pawn/tools—include them but note limitations?\n\nThe Golden Rule Jewelry LLC by Danessa Stewart could be another entry for jewelry-specific appraisal.\n\nOthers like Men With Wood or Rick Turpin are dealers per source9; unless stated otherwise that they provide formal USPAP-compliant appraisal reports which isn't clear here so better exclude unless explicit mention exists elsewhere about offering professional appraisal services beyond sales/dealing.\n\n\nService areas would generally be within Wichita metro area based on business addresses noted across sources.\n\n\nPricing isn’t directly mentioned except event-based pricing at PBS Kansas Antique Fair where $75 gets one appraisal session(source3), but standard rates aren’t detailed elsewhere so may need to state typical ranges vary by item complexity.\n\n\nContact info should pull phone numbers/addresses where available e.g., Jewellery Savers has address on 47th St N.W., A OK Pawn two locations etc.\n\n\nYears in business can be inferred if possible e.g., Jewellery Savers since 1971 (~54 years), Art Of estates established date unclear though Brady Dreasher has extensive experience traveling globally according to bio(source3).\n\nCertifications: ISA CAPP/GPPA/CES/CAGA/WSTI for Brady Dreasher(ASA?), Denice Morris MA ASA etc.\n\n\nPutting it all together into sections:\n\nOverview first mentioning key players then list each entity with details extracted.\n</think>\n\nHere's a concise directory of professional antique/appraisal services operating within the Greater Wichita area:\n\n---\n\n### **Antique Appraisal Services Overview**\nWichita offers diverse valuation expertise through credentialed specialists covering fine art/jewelery/toys/musical instruments/general residential contents ([10]).
