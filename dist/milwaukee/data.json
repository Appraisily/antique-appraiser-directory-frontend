      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services in Milwaukee is mentioned. They have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, and Stephanie Calman. Their services include estate tax appraisals, fine art, antiques, furniture, and insurance documentation. They are ISA members and IRS qualified with USPAP standards. Contact info is via their website or phone.\n\nSource [5] also mentions Prestige Estate Services again but adds more details like remote appraisals and certifications from ISA and ASA. Their process includes initial consultation and detailed reports for legal purposes.\n\nSource [3] talks about an Antiques Roadshow appraisal in Milwaukee where John A. Hays from Christie's appraised an 18th-century Chippendale armchair. However, this seems like a one-time event rather than a local service provider.\n\nSource [9] mentions Craig Husar Fine Diamonds in Brookfield (near Milwaukee) with Britney Krueger as a Registered Gemologist Appraiser focusing on jewelry but not specifically antiques outside of that niche.\n\nSource [10] lists Cedarburg Auction & Appraisals LLC located in Brown Deer (part of the Milwaukee area). They have been around since 2002 according to their LiveAuctioneers profile but don't specify specialties beyond general auctions; reviews mention good service but not specific antique expertise.\n\nOther sources like [2], [4], [6], [7], etc., discuss sports memorabilia appraisers or home/property appraisals which aren't relevant here except maybe Bob Connelly from source[2] who does estate sales but isn’t explicitly located in Milwaukee—might be worth checking if he's local? The search result says \"Bob & Sally Connelly Appraisals\" without specifying location; however the article groups them under best for estate appraisals generally so maybe not local enough for inclusion here unless confirmed elsewhere which it isn’t—so probably exclude him unless there's clear indication he serves Milwaukee area which there isn't based on given data).\n\nNow compiling all entries:\n\n1) Prestige Estate Services: Multiple team members listed (Edward Kitson et al.), specialties include antiques among other personal property types; certifications ISA/ASA/USPAP; contact via website/phone; serving greater Milwaukee area including suburbs like Wauwatosa etc.; pricing likely varies by service type—source[5] mentions competitive pricing upon quote request years active implied by decades of experience mentioned perhaps over 20 years?\n\n2) Cedarburg Auction & Appraisals LLC: Located nearby Brown Deer WI part of metro-Milwaukee region per address given (53223 zip code). Since 2002 operating so ~23 years now? Specializes auctions possibly handling estates which could involve antiques though exact specialty unclear beyond general items sold at auction houses noted positive reviews suggest reliability contact info available via LiveAuctioneers page phone number provided(262-238-5555).\n\n3) Craig Husar Fine Diamonds: Focused primarily jewelry especially diamonds/gemstones through GIA-certified staff might handle vintage jewelry as part broader appraisal services located Brookfield WI adjacent city within service area listed under \"serving entire milwaukee area\". So while main focus is jewelry they do mention vintage pieces thus could be included as secondary option if someone has antique jewelry needs even though not pure antique furniture/appraisal experts themselves?\n\nJohn A Hays from Christie’s was part Antique Roadshow event held locally once doesn’t mean permanent presence so exclude him unless evidence shows otherwise none found here therefore omit his entry into directory since no ongoing business presence established through sources provided.)\n\nNow structure sections:\n\nOverview should summarize key points about Milw market citing prestige estates leading provider with multiple specialists USPAP compliance etc., plus others offering related services like auctions or niche areas(jewelry).\n\nList each eligible firm with details pulled from sources ensuring accuracy check against duplicates e.g., Prestige appears twice across different URLs ([1]/[5]) consolidate into single entry noting all relevant info combined such as team names certs offered services contact methods etc.)\n\nService areas need geographic scope per each company e.g., Prestige covers surrounding cities while Cedarburg serves Brown Deer/Brookfield regions Pricing ranges inferred where possible example homeadvisor.com avg costs may apply generically but specific data missing except when stated upfront fees vary case-by-case basis hence note that prices depend on item complexity/appraisal type\n\nContact info must include phone numbers websites addresses hours only if available some companies list hours others don't so leave blank when unspecified\n\nNotable certifications highlight ISA ASA GIA credentials where applicable \n\nYears derived either directly stated (“since 2002”) or implied through “decades” experience wording approximate accordingly \n\nFinal check ensure conciseness factual adherence avoid unsupported claims verify all data points against sources before finalizing\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Milwaukee  \n\nMilwaukee offers specialized appraisal services for antiques through accredited professionals adhering to USPAP standards.
