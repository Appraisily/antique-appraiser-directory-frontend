      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Phoenix, Arizona based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results. The main sources here are from Prestige Estate Services (results 1-3, 6-8), which have multiple appraisers listed like Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman, Erika Holycross, Alicia Weaver. There's also Precious Metals Refinery (result 4) which does jewelry appraisals but mentions Tucson; maybe they serve Phoenix? Then Asian Antique Appraisers (result7) but their website is asianantiqueappraisers.com—not sure if they operate in Phoenix. Result5 talks about rug appraisals but Ellen Amirkhan is in Dallas. Result9 and10 are about home appraisals which might not be relevant here.\n\nSo focusing on Prestige Estate Services first since they have a Phoenix location mentioned in result1. Their team includes several appraisers: Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman from result1; Erika Holycross (result3), Alicia Weaver (result8). Each has different specialties.\n\nResult6 mentions their antique appraisal services specifically: furniture appraisal including age patina assessment etc., so that's part of specialties.\n\nContact info for Prestige is from result1: phone number 1-844-ITEM-VAL and email Appraisal@PrestigeEstateServices.com. Business hours aren't listed explicitly but probably standard unless noted otherwise.\n\nPricing info: From result3 under \"Why Choose Us\" section says non-regulated at $175/hr and IRS-regulated at $225/hr; full estate $1-$2 per sq ft. Also mention online photo valuations free? Wait no—looking back at result6 under FAQs question5 says costs vary by type but offers competitive pricing with quotes upon request.\n\nOther possible entries:\n\nPrecious Metals Refinery does jewelry appraisals in Tucson (result4). But query is about Phoenix—maybe they have other locations? The site says \"Our jewelry appraisal services are currently not available in our California stores.\" So maybe only Tucson AZ locations mentioned there; unclear if serving Phoenix too. Probably exclude unless there's explicit mention.\n\nAsian Antique Appraisers (Baker Appraisers?) from result7—their website asianantiqueappraiser.com doesn't specify location beyond specializing in Asian antiques; contact page would need to check if they serve Phoenix or not since no address given here except maybe via email/phone consultation?\n\nEllen Amirkhan from ARCS (result5) seems based in Dallas TX so likely not relevant for Phoenix directory.\n\nHomeAdvisor cost info isn't directly related to antique appraising but more real estate/home appraisal so skip that part except perhaps note that home vs personal property/appraisal differs?\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\nFor Prestige Estate Services:\n\nThey're located in Phoenix according to [1]. Team members include Edward Kitson et al., plus Erika Holycross who specializes fine art/antiques/collectibles with ISA certification/USPAP compliance [3]. Alicia Weaver as president overseeing nationwide team [8].\n\nSpecialties would include antiques across various categories like furniture art etc., certifications ISA/USPAP compliant IRS-qualified [2][6][8].\n\nService areas: Nationwide including multiple states but specifically mention servingPhoenix AZ[1][8].\n\nYears in business: Since 2010 when Alicia founded it[8].\n\nContact info same across all entries under Prestige?\n\nWait individual profiles may differ:\n\nE.g., Erika Holycross has her own page[3] with phone same as general number(844 ITEM VAL), email specific to her or general?\n\nIn her profile contact details say Phone: same number EmailAppraisal@... So likely all go through main line/department rather than individual contacts unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo listing each individual within Prestige might be redundant since it's one company with multiple staff members specializing differently?\n\nBut user wants list as many antique appraiseRS as possible so even if part of same company should list them separately if possible?\n\nLooking back at source[1], Meet Our Team lists Edward Kitson Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman —but no further details on them individually except names whereas other sources detail others like Erika H and Alicia W who have more information available elsewhere like their bios/certifications/specialties etc..\n\nHmm tricky because some team members don’t have detailed bios while others do.E.g.,Edward Kitson’s name appears only once without any specifics.So perhaps focus on those with detailed profiles:Erika H,Alicia W,and then group others under the main company entry mentioning additional staff without specifics due lack data availability？\n\nAlternatively present the company first then list key personnel within it along their specialties/certs/etc.. But user wants each entry to be an 'appraiser' possibly implying separate businesses.But given that these are employees of PES，maybe treat PES as one entity listing its key personnel inside？\n\nAlternatively split into separate entries per named professional where sufficient data exists.For example,Erika Holycross has her own bio page（source3）so she can be listed individually.Alicia Weaver also has own profile（source8）as President.Prestige Estates overall can be another entry covering other team members？But this could lead duplication.I think better approach is present PES作为公司，然后列出他们的团队成员及其专长。\n\nUser asked for \"list as many antique appraiseRS\"所以可能需要尽可能多的名字。但有些只有名字没有其他信息，如Edward等。可能只能提到他们作为团队的一部分。\n\n因此：\n\nOverview部分：Phoenix的评估服务主要由像Prestige这样的公司提供，涵盖各种古董类型，认证包括ISA、USPAP等。\n\nList部分：\n\n主要条目是：\n\n-Prestige Estate Services：地址在Phoenix；团队成员包括多个有认证的评估师；专长包括家具、艺术品、收藏品等；联系方式统一；成立时间2010年；\n\n-Erika Holycross：属于该公司但可能有单独列出？因为她的个人页面详细说明她的背景和专长；\n\n-Alicia Weaver：创始人兼总裁；\n\n另外可能还有其他公司的条目比如Asian Antique Appraiser如果他们在凤凰城运营的话。根据结果7中的asianantiqueappraiser.com的信息不确定是否在凤凰城有业务。他们的网站说“Schedule an appointment”但没有具体地址可能需要远程服务或在线评估。如果用户要求的是凤凰城的本地评估师则可能排除他们除非明确提到服务区域包含那里。\n\n同样地,Precious Metals Refinery位于Tucson只做珠宝鉴定且未提Phoenix的服务区域所以可能不适用。\n\n因此可能的目录结构为：\n\nOverview\n\nListed Companies/Apprasiers:\n\n-Prestige Estate Services Inc.:团队包括Alicia W.(总裁)，Erica H.(专家)，以及其他成员如Edward等人（但无详细信息）\n\n其他可能的条目如果有的话需要确认是否有其他公司在凤凰城运营的古董评估师例如Baker Appraises或其他人但从搜索结果中没有更多信息了。\n\n\n现在处理每个部分的细节：\n\nOverview部分应总结凤凰城的古董鉴定服务情况基于搜索结果中提到的内容例如IRS合规性、USPAP标准、多种类型的古董鉴定如家具艺术收藏品等由专业公司提供。\n\n\n名单中的每个评估师或公司需要名称业务详情专长联系信息年限认证等等。\n\n\n对于价格和服务区域:Prestige的价格在非监管每小时$175起IRS监管$225起全屋按平方英尺收费$1-$2每平方英尺。[来源结果3和结果6]\n\n服务区域覆盖全国但在本案例中关注的是Phoenix AZ.\n\n\n联系信息来自结果中的电话号码和邮箱以及网站地址。\n\n\n营业时间未明确提及需注明“Contact for hours”或者假设为标准工作时间除非另有说明.\n\n\n现在整理成目录格式确保符合用户的请求保持简洁事实性。\n</think>\n\n**Antique Appraiser Directory – Phoenix Metropolitan Area**  \n\n---\n\n### **Overview**  \nPhoenix hosts specialized professionals offering IRS-compliant personal property valuations adhering to USPAP standards ([Source](https://prestigeestateservices.com/locations/phoenix-arizona/) [^6]).
