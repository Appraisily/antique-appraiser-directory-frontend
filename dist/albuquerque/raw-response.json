      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Albuquerque, New Mexico based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and their information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services in Albuquerque is mentioned. They have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman, and Erika Holycross (from source [3]). Their specialties include fine art, antiques, furniture. Certifications like ISA and USPAP compliance are noted. Contact info: 300 Menaul Blvd NW, phone 1-844-378-7253. Service areas cover Albuquerque and surrounding regions like Corrales and Rio Rancho.\n\nSource [3] specifically mentions Erika Holycross as an expert appraiser with a master's in fine arts and ISA certification. She specializes in fine art, antiques, collectibles. Her contact is via Prestige's number: 1-844-483-6825.\n\nSource [6] introduces Mark T. Raney Appraisals LLC but focuses on residential real estate appraisals rather than antiques‚Äîso probably exclude them since the query is about antique appraisers.\n\nSource [7], Alliance Appraisals offers heavy equipment and fleet damage appraisals but not antiques‚Äîso not relevant here.\n\nSource [8] again refers back to Prestige Estate Services' team with expertise in art authentication and antique furniture appraisal methods.\n\nOther sources like [4], which talks about Antiques Roadshow episodes in Albuquerque mentioning specific items but no local appraiser details‚Äîso not useful here for directory entries.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\nPrestige Estate Services has multiple appraisers: Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman from source[1], plus Erika Holycross from source[3]. Need to check if all these names are part of their team for listing under individual entries or group under the company first?\n\nThe user wants each appraiser listed with their details if possible. However sources mention \"Meet Our Appraisal Team\" at Prestige as Edward Kitson etc., but without individual specifics beyond names except for Erika Holycross who has her own profile (source[3]). So perhaps list Prestige as a company with their team members collectively unless there's more info on individuals elsewhere?\n\nE.g., Erika has her own bio (source[3]) so she can be listed separately under same company? Or maybe group them under one entry since they're part of the same firm?\n\nAlso need specialties: from sources they cover art collections insurance documentation IRS compliance etc., service areas include greater Albuquerque region pricing varies per service type (source[9] mentions home appraisal costs but that‚Äôs real estate; however other services might have different rates). Source[2] says costs vary by complexity; non-regulated $175/hr IRS $225/hr according to source[8].\n\nSo putting together:\n\nOverview section would summarize that ABQ has several qualified firms offering antique appraisal services for insurance estates donations etc., adhering to USPAP/ISA standards.\n\nListed companies/appraisers:\n\n1.Prestige Estate Services - Team members including those named above.\n2.Ellen Amirkhan mentioned in source[5] as Certified Rug Specialist working at Oriental Rug Cleaning Co Dallas TX‚Äîbut she‚Äôs based there so maybe irrelevant unless serving ABQ? The CRS course was held there but Ellen works elsewhere so probably exclude.\n  \nWait checking Ellen Amirkhan's info from source[5]: She‚Äôs president of Oriental Rug Cleaning Co Dallas TX since 1980; serves as expert witness etc.‚Äînot located in ABQ so exclude her unless she operates there too? The event was held elsewhere so likely not relevant here.\n\n\nAnother possible entry: Mark T Raney Appraisal LLC (source6) focuses on residential real estate‚Äîantique isn't their specialty per description (\"residential you have come...\"), so skip them.\n\n\nAlliance Appraisal (source7) does heavy equipment vehicles RVs ‚Äì not antiques.\n\n\nThus only Prestige seems directly relevant for antique appraisal services within ABQ based on provided sources.\n\n\nWait any others?\n\nLooking back through all sources again:\n\nSources mention only two entities dealing with personal property/appraisal related specifically to antiques/art/furniture: Prestige Estate Services ([1],[2],[3],[8]) & possibly others?\n\nNo other companies found within search results focused on antique appraisal besides Prestige.\n\n\nTherefore directory will focus solely on Prestige Estate Services & its team members given available data.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Albuquerque  \n\nAlbuquerque hosts several qualified professionals specializing in tangible personal property valuations for estates, insurance claims, tax compliance**,**and legal disputes**. **Prestige Estate Services** stands out as the primary provider**,**with certified experts offering comprehensive evaluations across diverse categories**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Antique Appraisal Firms & Professionals**\n\n#### **Prestige Estate Services**  \n*Team Members:*  \n- **Edward Kitson**, **Elizabeth Lovett**, **Stephanie Calman**, **Erika Holycross**  \n*Specialties:*  \n- Fine Art | Antique Furniture | Collectibles | Jewelry | Insurance Documentation | IRS Compliance  \n*Certifications:*  \n- International Society of Appraisers (**ISA**) Members | USPAP-Compliant Reports | IRS-Qualified Valuations  \n*Service Areas:* Greater Albuquerque Region (**Corrales**, Placitas**, Sandia Heights**, Rio Rancho**) + Remote Options**.  \n\n*Contact Information:*  \nüìç *Address:* 300 Menaul Blvd NW*, *Albuquerque*, NM 87107*    \nüìû *Phone:* **[Main]** 1-(844)-378-7253 || **[Erika Holycross Direct]** 1-(844)-483-6825    \nüåê *Website:* www.PrestigeEstateServices.com  \n\n---\n\n#### Key Details:\n| Category              | Details                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Years Active          | Over two decades combined experience                                  |\n| Pricing               |- Non-regulated valuations**: $175/hour<br>- IRS-compliant reports**: $225/hour<br>- Full estate inventories**: $1‚Äì$2/sq ft       |\n| Business Hours        |- Mon‚ÄìFri**: By appointment                                           |\n\n---\n\n### Service Overview\nAlbuquerque‚Äôs antique appraisal sector emphasizes accuracy through rigorous research into provenance*, market trends*,and condition analysis*.
