Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned as providing government appraisal services with a nationwide network of IRS-qualified appraisers. They have expertise in art, antiques, and collectibles. Their contact info isn't directly listed here, but they mention being located in various places and having USPAP certification.\n\nSource [2] talks about Dana Summitt from Look Appraisal LLC. She's an ISA AM certified appraiser specializing in fine art, including 20th-century paintings and photography. Her contact details are in Raleigh, NC, and she serves areas like Durham and Cary.\n\nSource [4] is Appraising Plus based in NC with over 15 years of experience. They handle insurance, estate appraisals, divorce cases etc., covering items like war memorabilia and rare books.\n\nSource [5] also refers to Look Appraisal again (Dana Summitt), emphasizing her USPAP compliance and specialties similar to what's mentioned earlier.\n\nSource [10] mentions AppraiseItNow operating in North Carolina with online services but doesn't specify Raleigh specifically; however they do cover personal property including antiques.\n\nOther sources like [3], [6]-[9] don't seem relevant as they discuss chamber of commerce listings or home selling tips which aren't related to antique appraisers.\n\nNow compiling the list: Prestige Estate Services (from source 1), Dana Summitt/Look Appraisal (sources 2 &5), Appraising Plus (source4), and AppraiseItNow (source10). Need their business details from each source.\n\nFor specialties: Prestige covers federal assets but also art/antiques; Dana focuses on fine art; Appraising Plus does various personal property; AppraiseItNow mentions medical equipment but also general personal property—maybe adjust for antiques?\n\nContact info needs phone/website where available. Years in business: Prestige isn’t specified beyond \"nationwide network\", Dana has ISA AM since date not given but likely recent due to 2024 dates;Appraising Plus has over 15 years per their site.AppraiseItNow’s testimonials are from 2025 so active now.Certifications: USPAP for all probably.Pricing is vague except maybe mentioning typical ranges if any found.Service areas—Raleigh plus surrounding regions noted by each company.Business hours not explicitly stated anywhere except maybe LookAppointment required for some.\n</think>\n\nHere's a concise directory of antique appraisal services in Raleigh:\n\n---\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Services Overview**  \nRaleigh offers specialized appraisal firms handling fine art, furniture collections & unique heirlooms.
