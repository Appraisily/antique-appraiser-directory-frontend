      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Richmond, Virginia based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and their information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Alicia E Weaver (Prestige Estate Services)** is mentioned in [1], [2], [3]. She's a Certified Appraiser (ISA CAPP) with specialties in antiques, furnishings, decorative arts. Based in Richmond? The website mentions servicing clients anywhere but her team has office locations. Wait, the URL for Prestige Estate Services is linked to Salt Lake City? Hmm, but Alicia's profile says she's part of Prestige Estate Services which offers online and in-person services. The blog posts from Prestige mention Virginia specifically in [3] and [6]. Maybe they have a presence there.\n\n2. **Shield Asset Appraisals** is listed in [10], based in Richmond VA explicitly. They do furniture appraisals.\n\n3. **Doyle Auctioneers** ([9]) have a DC/Mid-Atlantic office that serves Richmond area; they handle antiques and art.\n\n4. **AppraiseItNow** ([6]) operates online but includes Virginia; Julia P.'s testimonial might be from there.\n\n5. **HomeAdvisor listings** ([4]) mention Salt Lake City pros but not sure about Richmond ones.\n\nWait, some sources might not be directly relevant to Richmond VA:\n\n- Source [4] talks about Salt Lake City appraisers.\n- Source [5] is an Antiques Roadshow appraisal example.\n- Source [7] discusses home appraisal costs generally.\n- Source [8] is a bank’s annual report unrelated.\n  \nSo focusing on sources that mention Virginia or Richmond:\n\nFrom source[1]: Alicia E Weaver’s ISA profile doesn't specify location but her company Prestige Estate Services' blog ([3]) mentions serving clients searching for \"antique furniture appraiser near me\" including Virginia areas like Wythe County (from another example). However, Shield Asset Appraisals ([10]) are explicitly in Richmond VA.\n\nDoyle Auctioneers ([9]) are located in DC/Mid-Atlantic region and serve Richmond as per their examples (mentions collections from McLean and estates like Hillwood).\n\nAppraiseItNow ([6]) operates online but covers Virginia; testimonials include someone named James H., possibly from VA?\n\nSo compiling the list:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services**: Alicia Weaver leads this team with ISA CAPP certification; specialties include antiques/furniture/decorative arts/art etc., USPAP compliant.[1][2][3]\n\n2.**Shield Asset Appraisals**: Based directly in Richmond[10].\n\n3.**Doyle (DC/Mid-Atlantic)**: Serve Mid-Atlantic including DC/VA areas.[9]\n\n4.**AppraiseItNow**: Online service covering VA.[6]\n\nFor each entry:\n\nName/Business: Need business names as per sources.\n\nSpecialties: As listed per source.\n\nContact info: Websites provided—prestigeestateservices.com for Alicia/Shield has shieldapg.com etc.—but need to check if addresses are present or just websites/years?\n\nYears In Business: Not always specified—maybe infer from dates on pages? For example Prestige’s content was updated 2024 so maybe established earlier?\n\nCertifications: ISA CAPP for Alicia[1]; USPAP compliance mentioned across several entries like Shield[10], Prestige[1].\n\nService Areas/Pricing:\n\nPrestige offers remote/in-person/photos pricing varies by complexity.[2][7]\nShield likely similar since they're local.\nDoyle does auctions/appraisal services with consignment options.[9]\nAppraiseItNow starts at $150+ depending on item type.[6]\n\nContact Info & Hours:\nWebsites would have contact forms or numbers; specific hours may not be listed except Doyle has consignment dates mentioned[9].\n\nPutting it all together concisely while ensuring accuracy based on sources cited correctly without adding unsupported info.\n</think>\n\n### Directory of Antique Appraisers in Richmond, Virginia  \n\n#### Overview  \nRichmond boasts specialized antique appraisal services catering to insurance claims, estate planning, resale valuations (**USPAP-compliant reports**[1][10]), litigation support (**expert witness testimony**[1]), and charitable donations (**IRS-qualified documentation**[6]).
