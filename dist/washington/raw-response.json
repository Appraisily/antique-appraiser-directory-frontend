Let me start by going through the search results provided. \n\nFirst, looking at result [2], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned as offering personal property appraisals in Washington, D.C., including antiques. They have a team with Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, and Stephanie Calman. Their specialties include estate tax, art, and antique appraisals. Contact info is 1-(844) 378-7253 and their website is prestigestateservices.com. They mention IRS compliance and USPAP standards.\n\nResult [6] talks about Doyle‚ÄîDC / Mid-Atlantic location. They are auctioneers and appraisers of fine art and antiques. Their contact is DoyleDC@Doyle.com or 301-348-5282. They have experience with estates like the Kennedy Center chairman's collection.\n\nResult [7] again mentions Prestige Estate Services with more details on their appraisal process: in-person, remote, photo-based options; certified by ISA and ASA; reports for legal/insurance use; cost varies but competitive pricing.\n\nResult [4] discusses Busby Antiques offering in-home appraisals but they're based in Casselberry, FL‚Äîso maybe not relevant for D.C.? But wait the user asked for Washington D.C., so maybe that's a mistake? Or do they serve D.C.? The URL says DC but content mentions FL... Hmm conflicting info here? Need to check if Busby serves DC or if it's an error.\n\nOther results like [1], [3], [5], etc., provide general info on appraisal services but not specific to DC except Prestige and Doyle.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\nPrestige Estate Services seems solid with multiple mentions ([2], [7]). Then there's Doyle ([6]). Are there others?\n\nLooking at result [9]: Antique Arena offers appraisals at $200/hour but not sure if they're based in DC‚Äîwebsite might be generic? The URL says antiquearena.com/appraisal but no specific location mentioned except travel fees from \"our offices\"‚Äîbut where are those offices? Not clear if they operate in DC.\n\nResult [8]: Cascade Real Property Appraisal specializes in real estate so probably not relevant for antiques.\n\nSo main ones are Prestige Estate Services (Washington-based) and Doyle (DC/Mid-Atlantic). Maybe Busby Antiques isn't actually serving DC despite the URL mentioning it‚Äîmaybe a misindexed page?\n\nFor each entry:\n\nName/Business: Prestige Estate Services\nSpecialties: Artwork (paintings/sculptures), Antique furniture/jewelry/collectibles\nContact: Phone number from result[2]\nYears: Not explicitly stated but \"decades of experience\" per result[7]\nCerts: ISA & ASA certifications\n\nDoyle:\nName/Business: DOYLE ‚Äì DC / Mid-Atlantic\nSpecialties: Fine art auctions/appraisal including antiques\nContact details from result[6]\n\nService areas would be Washington D.C., possibly surrounding regions like Georgetown etc.\nPricing ranges from $100-$250/hour as per general info ([1]), while specific ones vary (Antique Arena $200/hr).\n\nNeed to structure this into sections as per query requirements.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Washington, District of Columbia  \n\n### **Overview**  \nWashington‚Äôs antique appraisal sector combines expertise across fine art collections, historical artifacts insurance valuations estate planning needs Local professionals adhere USPAP standards ensuring IRS-compliant reports Trusted firms offer hybrid services including virtual evaluations  \n\n---\n\n### **List of Appraisers**  \n\n#### **1.
