Let me start by reviewing each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services in Tucson is mentioned. They have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, and Stephanie Calman. They offer various appraisal services like estate tax, insurance, antiques, fine art. Certifications include ISA and ASA. Contact info is probably on their website but not explicitly listed here; maybe I can note their website URL from the source link.\n\nSource [2] also refers to Prestige Estate Services again but focuses more on their antique appraisal process and credentials. It mentions they have over 75 years combined experience and use ISA/ASA certifications.\n\nSource [3] is Bear & Raven Appraisal with rates: onsite $150/hr (2-hour min), office inspection $75/hr (1-hour min). Located in Midtown Tucson. Their website URL might be the contact info.\n\nSource [6] talks about Precious Metals Refinery offering jewelry appraisals with GIA-certified gemologists at 7069 E Tanque Verde Rd., Tucson. They do in-person appraisals but take up to 10 days for return.\n\nSource [7] mentions Antique Appraisers Auctioneers but doesn't specify location details for Tucson; maybe they're a national service? Not sure if local to Tucson based on this info alone.\n\nOther sources like [4], [5], [8]-[10] don't provide specific Tucson antique appraiser details except HomeAdvisor's general cost info which can help with pricing sections.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services**: Multiple team members listed in sources [1][2][10]. Specialties include antiques, fine art, estate tax appraisals etc., ISA/ASA certified.\n2. **Bear & Raven Appraisal**: Rates from source[3].\n3. **Precious Metals Refinery**: Jewelry-specific from source[6].\n\nNeed business hours where possible—source[6] says drop-off available at all locations but no specific hours mentioned elsewhere; might need to omit or note \"contact for hours.\"\n\nService areas: Most are based in Tucson city as per addresses given (Midtown/Tanque Verde Rd).\n\nNotable certifications: ISA/ASA for Prestige; GIA for PMR.\n\nYears in business: Prestige mentions over 75 years combined experience; Bear & Raven's site was updated Feb 2025 so likely established earlier?\n\nContact info should use URLs provided since phone numbers aren't listed here except PMR's address.\n</think>\n\nTucson offers specialized antique appraisal services through accredited professionals and firms catering to insurance needs, estate planning, sales valuations**,** and IRS compliance**.
