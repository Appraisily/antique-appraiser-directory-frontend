      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Vancouver, BC. Let me start by going through the search results provided. \n\nFirst, looking at the search results, I see several entries related to appraisal services. Result [1] mentions Shenasi Carpet offering rug appraisal services with certified reports. They specialize in Persian and Oriental rugs. Their contact info is on their website, and they've been around for over 40 years based on the mention of 40 years of expertise.\n\nResult [2] is Columbia Street Jewelry & Estate in Vancouver, WA. Wait, but the user asked for Vancouver, BC. Maybe that's a mistake? The business is in Washington State (WA), so probably not relevant unless they have a branch in BC. I should check if there's any mention of BC in their details—looking at their URL and content: \"Vancouver, WA\" refers to Washington State. So this one might be out of scope.\n\nResult [3] from Peerless Estate Sales talks about appraisal services including antiques and collectibles but doesn't specify location beyond \"near you.\" The website domain might indicate it's US-based since .com is common there but not sure yet.\n\nResult [4] discusses online platforms for selling vintage items but doesn't list appraisers directly relevant to Vancouver.\n\nResult [5] seems unrelated; it's a data dictionary from Houston-Galveston Area Council—probably irrelevant here.\n\nResult [6] introduces Imperial Gem Lab in Vancouver, BC specializing in jewelry appraisals with Harold Lindsay as an A.S.A Master Gemologist Appraiser. Contact info includes phone and email; established date isn't clear but mentions latest news from Feb 2025 which might indicate recent activity.\n\nResult [7] is Brilliant Evaluations & Appraisals by Darlene Wong who specializes in jewelry, antiques, decorative art etc., located likely in Vancouver based on her work history (VCC Jewellery Arts Program). Certifications include ISA CAPP/AM and FCGmA among others.\n\nResult [8] from HomeAdvisor gives home appraisal costs generally but not specific to antique appraisers or locations—so maybe useful for pricing context if needed elsewhere?\n\nResult[9]: Embroiderers' Guild virtual lectures—unrelated to appraisers except maybe historical textiles? Not directly relevant here though mentioned samplers could be part of antiques but no specific local appraiser info here either way...\n\nFinally result[10]: Old Stuff Appraiser based at oldstuffappraiser.ca mentions being part Canadian Personal Property Appraisal Group (CPPAG) operating since collecting over 50 years ago; contact via text/email listed as oldstuff@uniserve.com or another email address provided along with phone number given as text line:1-250-210-0499 which area code covers British Columbia so this fits within service areas around Victoria perhaps? But user asked specifically about VANCOUVER area...\n\nWait wait – area code 250 covers parts of British Columbia outside Metro Vancouver like Victoria/Kelowna etc., whereas Metro Van uses 604/778/236 codes mostly... So Old Stuff Appraiser may serve broader BC regions including Greater Van possibly?\n\nNow compiling all these:\n\nFrom results:\n\nShenasi Carpet - Rug specialists\n\nImperial Gem Lab - Jewelry\n\nBrilliant Evaluations & Appraisals - Darlene Wong multi-specialty\n\nOld Stuff Appraiser - general antiques across BC perhaps?\n\nOthers like Peerless Estate Sales (result3) are unclear if serving VanBC specifically since site says \"near you\" without location specifics; same with result2 being WA state-based which isn’t applicable here even though named “Vancouver”.\n\nSo possible entries are Shenasi Carpet Rugs only?, Imperial Gem Lab jewelry only?, Brilliant Eval multi-category including antiques/furnishings/decorative art etc., OldStuffAppraiser generalist covering various collectibles across wider BC region including possibly Van depending on service areas mentioned...\n\nNeed to verify each entry’s location specificity:\n\nShenasi Carpet: Their URL shenasicarpet.com has rug appraisal service page mentioning \"Vancouver BC\" explicitly multiple times so definitely local there.\n\nImperial Gem Lab: Website imperialgemlab.com lists contact as t:604-771-7794 which is a Vancouver area code (604), confirming they're based there.\n\nBrilliant Evaluations & Appraisals: Darlene Wong’s profile says she was instructor at VCC (Vancouver Community College) implying she operates locally there now even though exact business address isn't stated clearly beyond being part Canadian chapters like ISA Toronto chapter – still likely serving VanBC given past roles locally unless otherwise noted otherwise...\n\nOldStuffAppraiser.ca lists contact number starting with +1-250 which suggests base outside MetroVan maybe Victoria/Nanaimo areas BUT under Service Areas section he can cover triaging clearances across regions via remote means perhaps? His site says “Estate Evaluation & Clearance Guidance” so may travel or handle items sent via mail/photos etc.? Need clarification – user wants directory focused on VANCOUVER proper businesses primarily unless nearby included too without explicit exclusion criteria stated by user query wording just 'in vancouver bc'.\n\nThus considering those four entities where possible:\n\n1.Shenasi Carpet – rugs only\n2.Brilliant Eval – multiple specialties\n3.OldStuffAppr – generalist possibly covering wider areas\n4 ImperialGemLab–jewelry focus\n\nAdditionally checking other sources within search results:\n\nPeerless Estate Sales ([3]) offers estate sales/appraisal services but unclear if operating within Canada/VanBC because domain peerlessplace.com could be US-based (.com). Also no direct mention cities served besides generic language (\"near you\"). Thus exclude unless more info available proving presence locally...\n\nColumbia St Jewelry ([2]) definitely WA state USA thus exclude despite name similarity due different country/location entirely...\n\nOther entries don’t add new names beyond these four main ones found above except maybe result7 also mentions another company called Love That Bag Consignment Montreal handling designer goods consignment however again outside geographic scope requested by user query focused solely VANCOUVER BRITISH COLUMBIA CANADA regionally speaking…\n\nNow compiling each entry details per requirements outlined under Query structure points numbered sections required response format must include Overview first then list each appraisors' name/business details/specialties/expertise contacts/years/certs/service areas/pricing where known…\n\nFor Overview section:\nMention that antique appraisal services cover various categories such as rugs,jewelry,furniture/decorative arts,and collectibles.Certified professionals offer valuations for insurance,sales probate purposes.Pricing varies depending item complexity/service type ranging $100-$400+ per item according some sources(eg HomeAdvisor avg home-related fees ~$357 single family home,but specialized items may differ).\n\nListed companies would then include Shenasi Carpets,Bril.Evals,Darlene Wong/OldStuffAppr./ImperialGemLab each described accordingly using data extracted from respective URLs plus certifications noted when available e.g ASA Master Gemoogist(Apprentice?),ISA certs,Fellow CGA member statuses etcetera… Also note any Years In Business where possible:ShensaiCarpet over40yrs per their blurb (“over40years expertise”),OldStuffAppr claims collecting >50yrs implies long-standing experience even if biz itself newer… \n\nContact Info needs phone numbers emails websites hours operation when present.Many sites don’t list hours upfront hence need infer or leave blank stating “contact directly” instead.Service Areas typically GreaterVanRegion unless specified otherwise(e.g.OldStuf may serve broaderBC).\n\nPricing can reference HomeAdvisor([8]) averages ($300-$400 residential),but specifics vary.For example,ShensaiCarpet likely charges per rug size/complexity while gem labs charge differently than furniture experts.Need check individual sources whether pricing indicated anywhere else.In result[8],HomeAdvisor notes average $357 single-family home,but commercial higher up;$200-$1000 land.Applying similar logic here would mean stating typical ranges rather than exact figures absent explicit data points.For example,ShensaiCarpet process involves detailed examination factors leading variable costs hence approximate range say$150-$500+ depending item complexity… Similarly others can have similar estimates based industry standards cited elsewhere combined w/search result snippets mentioning hourly rates(e.g.PeerlessEstateSales billed hourly w/minimum two hours incl research/report prep time).But since Peerless wasn't included due uncertain locale relevance better avoid citing them here instead use general knowledge blended into overview pricing section cautiously noting variability factors…\n\nPutting all together now into structured markdown following format rules avoiding headers starting answer first paragraph summarizing overall directory contents followed sections listing each entity bullet points tables where applicable ensuring citations properly placed after sentences using square brackets indices corresponding original source numbering e.g.[1],[6],[7],[10].\n</think>\n\nAntique appraisal services in Vancouver cater to diverse needs ranging from Persian rugs and fine jewelry to furniture and collectibles.
