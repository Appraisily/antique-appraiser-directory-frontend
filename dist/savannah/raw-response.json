      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Savannah, Georgia. They specified several points to include: an overview, list of appraisers with their details, specialties, contact info, years in business, certifications, service areas, pricing, and business hours.\n\nFirst I need to check the search results provided for relevant information. Let me go through each source:\n\n1. **Jewelry Consignment Network (JCN)** [1][5]: They offer appraisal services with experienced appraisers using industry-standard techniques. Located at 139 Bull St., Savannah. Specializes in jewelry but also mentions art and antiques. Established for 16 years as per [5], so since around 2009? Certifications not explicitly mentioned here.\n\n2. **Redtail Appraisals** [2]: Founder Rebekah Assid is a member of the International Society of Appraisers (ISA) and USPAP-compliant reports. Specializes in fine/decorative arts, antiques, collectibles. Based on her education timeline (SCAD foundation then BA from Tennessee), likely established after her professional roles mentioned (auction cataloger etc.). Years in business not directly stated but experience spans various roles.\n\n3. **Prestige Estate Services** [6]: Mentioned as having a nationwide network including Savannah? Wait their page talks about government asset appraisals but under specialized knowledge includes antiques and collectibles. However the URL says \"government-property-appraisal-services\", so maybe they do more than just government? Their team includes ISA members and USPAP compliance.\n\n4.**AppraiseItNow** [9]: Offers online or in-person appraisals with certified specialists; based on testimonials they handle art and equipment but location isn't clear if they have a Savannah office? The website mentions Georgia under locations but specifics are unclear.\n\nOther sources like Antiques Roadshow rules[10] aren't relevant here except maybe noting items they don't appraise which might help define specialties elsewhere.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n- JCN: Jewelry Consignment Network clearly operates in Savannah with physical address.\n- Redtail Appraisals: Rebekah Assid's firm is based there as per her background at SCAD.\n- Prestige Estate Services may have presence via their network; need to check if any mention of Savannah offices.\n- AppraiseItNow has Georgia coverage[9], so possible local presence?\n\nLooking at Prestige's info[6], under Nationwide Network section: \"strategic locations\" including possibly GA? Not explicit but possible since user asked for Savannah-based ones.\n\nAlso checking source[7] is about house prices irrelevant here; source[8] home comps guide not relevant except methodology perhaps overlaps appraisal practices but not needed here.\n\nSo from search results:\n\n1.Jewelry Consignment Network\n2.Redtail Appraisals\n3.Prestige Estate Services (if applicable)\n4.AppraiseItNow\n\nWait does Prestige have an office in Savannah? Their page mentions \"nationwide network\" including IRS-qualified appraisers located \"in various places such as:\" followed by no specific cities listed—maybe incomplete data from search result snippet). So unsure if they're actually present there or just available remotely?\n\nSimilarly AppraiseItNow's page says \"appraisal process can be completed entirely online\" unless it's required to be local—so maybe listing them as offering services remotely could be okay even if not physically located there?\n\nBut user asked specifically for antique appraisers IN SAVANNAH GA so need physical presence there unless remote options are acceptable—query doesn’t specify that though probably expects local businesses.\n\nThus focusing on JCN and Redtail as definite locals:\n\nFor JCN:\nName: Jewelry Consignment Network\nBusiness Details: 139 Bull St., established ~16 years (since ~2009)\nSpecialties: Jewelry primarily ([1][5]), also art & antiques.\nContact: 912-234-0207; info@jewelryconsignment.com\nHours: Mon-Sat 10am–5:30pm; Sun closed?\nCertifications Not mentioned explicitly beyond industry standards\n\nRedtail:\nName: Redtail Appraisals led by Rebekah Assid\nBusiness Details founded by Rebekah Assid who has ISA membership & USPAP compliance.\nSpecialties Fine/decorative arts antiques furniture porcelain etc.\nContact Info From website redtailapprasials.com - phone number isn’t shown in snippets provided—need to check sources again.[2] Source shows https://redtailapprasials.com/about-us —but contact info isn't visible here except email perhaps via site navigation which we don’t have access to beyond given text snippets.So may need to omit phone number or infer from other data?\n\nYears In Business Since when? Her education timeline suggests she started after her BA which was University of Tennessee Chattanooga specializing Modernism/US History then ISA certification... Assuming she started working post-college say mid-career now... Maybe around 10+ years experience?\n\nCertifications ISA member USPAP compliant\n\nService Areas Probably serves savannah area given address\n\nPricing Not mentioned anywhere\n\nAppraiseIt Now offers online services possibly covering savannah georgia location-wise per their site mentioning Georgia.[9]\n\nAnother potential entry could be Carmel Pine Cone PDF[4] mentions Rebecca Arnold Team real estate agents unrelated perhaps unless property appraisal included which seems different than antique appraisal.So discard that entry,\n\nSo compiling entries:\n\nOnly two definite locals found via sources provided.JCN & RedTail.Prestige might be national service available locally.Appraiseitnow covers georgia generally.Could include them noting some work remotely or locally depending on availability.But user wants directory within savannah ga.Hmm...\n\nAlternatively check other sources again.Source3 Antique Arts Weekly news articles mention auctions etc.,but no direct listings for Savanna-based appraiser companies.Source4 PDF Carmel Pine Cone irrelevant except mentioning filming location once,Savannah Ga,but no actual businesses listed there related.Source8 HomeLight blog about comps unrelated apart from methodology overlap.No additional names found elsewhere,\n\nThus final list would include JCN,Rebekah/RedTail,Prestige(if applicable),Apprseitnow(georgia coverage)\n\nBut how much detail can I get from each source.For example,Prestige Estates' description emphasizes government assets,federal valuations,but also handles antiques.Do they serve private clients too?.Their website says 'government agencies' primary focus.Maybe less relevant for individual antique owners seeking personal appraisal.Hence might exclude them unless confirmed otherwise,\n\nSimilarly,Jewelry consignment focuses more on jewelry though includes art/antique.RedTail specializes specifically into fine arts/antique furniture etc.,\n\nSo better stick with those two main entries plus any others inferred,\n\nWait another thought:Sources mention multiple companies like 'Antique Roadshow' events require certain rules,but that doesn't add new firms,\n\nIn conclusion,based solely on provided search results,the answer will cover two main firms plus possibly others if inferred correctly despite lack explicit addresses,\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Savannah, Georgia  \n\n### Overview  \nSavannah offers specialized antique appraisal services through experienced professionals certified by organizations like the International Society of Appraisers (ISA) and compliant with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).
