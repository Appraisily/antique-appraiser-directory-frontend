Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services** (Sources [1], [2], [9]) seems prominent. They offer various appraisal methods (in-person, remote, photo) and have Alicia E Weaver as a certified appraiser with ISA CAPP certification. Their specialties include art, furniture, decorative arts.\n\n2. **Fontaine's Auction Gallery** ([3]) is mentioned with a Palm Beach location. They provide auction services and appraisals but don't specify if they do antique appraisals specifically beyond general estate items.\n\n3. **Kaminski Auctions** ([7]) operates in Palm Beach and offers appraisal services for art and antiques as part of their auction house services.\n\n4. **Bill Hood and Sons** ([10]) is an auction house in Delray Beach (Palm Beach County) with over 30 years in business; they might offer appraisals but the source doesn't explicitly state it beyond selling estates.\n\n5. **WPB Watch Co** ([6]) specializes in watch appraisals but not broader antiques.\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor or Busby Antiques are either not located in Palm Beach or focus on different areas (e.g., home additions).\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\nFor Prestige Estate Services: Name from [1], contact info from [9] lists multiple numbers but needs specific ones for Palm Beach? Wait, their website is listed as prestigeestateservices.com which covers multiple locations including Florida per Alicia Weaver's profile[9]. So contact info would be via their main site/numbers unless there's a local address mentioned elsewhere? Source[3] mentions Fontaine's address: 700 S Rosemary Ave #592 West Palm Beach; Kaminski Auctions' address isn't directly given for Palm Beach except mentioning serving the area; Bill Hood is based in Delray Beach which is part of Palm Beach County.\n\nSpecialties should be pulled from each service: Prestige covers art/furniture/decorative arts; Fontaine's includes fine art & antiques; Kaminski similar to Fontaine's; WPB Watch only watches.\n\nCertifications: Prestige has ISA/ASA certifications[1][9]; others may not specify but can note membership in professional organizations if mentioned (e.g., Bill Hood mentions Live Auctioneers).\n\nYears in business: Prestige since at least 2012 per Alicia‚Äôs membership[9]; Fontaine‚Äôs over six decades[3]; Kaminski over three decades[7]; Bill Hood 30+ years[10].\n\nService areas would primarily be Palm Beach County unless specified otherwise. Pricing details are sparse except Prestige mentions varying costs based on type/complexity[1].\n\nContact info needs phone numbers/websites where available.\n</think>\n\nHere‚Äôs a concise directory of antique appraisal professionals serving the Greater West Palm Beaches area:\n\n---\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Services Overview ‚Äì Greater West Palms**\nPalm Beaches hosts specialized firms offering valuations via:\n- In-person inspections  \n- Remote video assessments  \n- Photo-based estimates  \nCommon uses include insurance coverage updates (~every 3‚Äì5 yrs), estate planning/settlements & resale prep[[1][2][8]].\n\n---\n\n## **Directory of Local Antique Appraisers**\n\n### **1\\.
