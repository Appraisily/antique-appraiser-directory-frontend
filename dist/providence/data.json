      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Providence, Rhode Island based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Source [1]** talks about Prestige Estate Services offering government appraisals but doesn't mention Providence specifically. They have a nationwide network but no direct link to Providence here.\n\n2. **Source [2]** is an Antiques Roadshow appraisal of a teapot in Jacksonville, not Providence. Not directly relevant.\n\n3. **Source [3]** mentions Buzz Hesse Antiques & Appraisals selling a projectile point for $18k, located in an unspecified location (probably not Providence). Not helpful.\n\n4. **Source [4]** is a PDF from Moore County Chamber; seems unrelated to Rhode Island or appraisers.\n\n5. **Source [5]** discusses Busby Antiques offering home appraisals but they're based in Casselberry, FL—not Providence.\n\n6. **Sources [6] and [7]**: Source [6] mentions Vintage Providence in relation to an Anne of Green Gables appraisal on PBS Wisconsin's site; Source [7] lists Benefit Street Antiques in Providence with appraisal services and contact info (243 Wickenden St). This is useful!\n\n7. **Sources[8],9**: Source[8] is about religious archives toolkit—unrelated; Source[9] is American Historic Coins & Collectibles' appraisal services but location isn't specified (maybe RI? Unclear).\n\n8.**Source[10]** provides house price data for Providence-Warwick area—irrelevant here.\n\nSo from all sources, only Benefit Street Antiques ([7]) explicitly operates in Providence with contact details and services mentioned: \"offers appraisals\" at 243 Wickenden St., phone +1401-751-9109, hours M-Sat 10am-5pm, Sun 1pm-5pm.\n\nOther potential entries might be inferred if any other sources mention RI-based appraisers:\n\nLooking again at source[6], the Anne of Green Gables appraisal was done by Francis J Wahlgren from Lillian Nassau LLC (New York), so not local to RI unless there's another connection missing here.\n\nVintageProvidence.org might be part of the event mentioned (source[6]), but no business details given beyond that episode's context—so probably can’t include them without more info.\n\nNo other sources provide specific antique appraiser businesses within Providence except Benefit Street Antiques as per source[7].\n\nTherefore, the directory will primarily list Benefit Street Antiques as confirmed provider in Prov., plus maybe others inferred if possible:\n\nWait: In source[3], Buzz Hesse sold an item via Public Sale auction house located near Hudson NY? Not sure if they operate in Prov., RI though likely not enough info there either...\n\nGiven limited data from provided sources focusing on Prov., only one clear entry exists: Benefit Street Antiques.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Providence, Rhode Island  \n\n### Overview  \nProvidence offers specialized antique appraisal services catering to collectors and institutions through expert firms like Benefit Street Antiques ([7]).
