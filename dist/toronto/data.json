      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Toronto based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and their information.\n\nFirst, looking at [1], Yorkville Auction Appraisals is mentioned. They have 25 years of experience and specialize in Middle East manuscripts, Persian/Ottoman, Asian, and European antiques. Their contact info is there: 160 Davenport Road, Toronto. That's one entry.\n\nNext, [2] talks about Kelly Juhasz from Fine Art Appraisal + Services. She has ISA AM certification and specializes in fine art and archives with a Master's in Archival Science. Her contact isn't directly listed but maybe inferred from the business name? Wait, the URL says she's part of ISA-Appraisers.org; perhaps her contact is through that site or her own business site.\n\nIn [3], several Canadian art specialists are listed under ISA Canada chapter. Names like Eliabeth Anne Cavaliere (Focal Point Appraisals), Laura Barcia (Bydealers Auction House), Michael Skerrett (Bay of Spirits Gallery), etc., but not all are in Toronto specifically. Need to check locations: Eliabeth is in Toronto; Laura Barcia is Montreal-based? Michael Skerrett is Mississauga—close enough for service area? Maybe include as serving Greater Toronto Area (GTA).\n\n[4] mentions Made You Look Jewellery for jewellery appraisals starting at $90 per piece with consultations at $60. They're located in Toronto but focus on jewellery rather than general antiques.\n\n[7] Woodland Cultural Centre doesn't offer appraisals but directs to ADAC and CADA for finding appraisers—maybe mention these associations as resources?\n\n[8] Waddingtons.ca lists upcoming auctions but not appraisal services directly unless they offer them as part of consignment—probably not relevant here.\n\nOther sources like [5], [6], [9], [10] don't seem relevant to antique appraisers in Toronto.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. Yorkville Auction Appraisals: 25 years experience.\n2. Kelly Juhasz/Fine Art Appraisal + Services: Certifications include ISA AM.\n3. Elizabeth Anne Cavaliere/Focal Point Appraisals: Member of ISA.\n4. Elham Ghorbanpour/MECA Gallery: Specializes in Islamic/Middle Eastern art.\n5 Sophie Ouellet/Galerie Cosner at Ritz Carlton Montreal—wait she’s based there so maybe exclude unless serving TO?\nWait Evlyne Laurin/Assemblage serves Montreal/Ottawa/Vancouver so probably out.\nMichael Skerrett/Bay of Spirits Gallery might be Mississauga which could be considered GTA?\n\nAlso check if any others from source 3 are located within Toronto proper:\n\n- Elham Ghorbanpour listed as Richmondhill/Toronto area? Yes.\n- Sarah Secter/Winnipeg – no\n- Julia Krueger/Saskatchewan – no\nSo only Eliabeth Anne Cavaliere (Toronto) and Elham Ghorbanpour (Richmondhill/Toronto) from that list may qualify.\n\nFrom source 6 Collector Vehicle Appraiser listings have several entries under \"Toronto\" section:\nDanny Kroll/Roadshow Automotive,\nAntique & Classic Auto,\nMaurice Bramhall & Associates,\nPaul Calderone Appraisal Inc.,\nBut these are vehicle-specific so maybe separate category or note their specialty?\n\nFor service areas/pricing:\nYorkville mentions catering locally and US neighbors; pricing not specified except Made You Look starts at $90 for jewelry; Kelly Juhasz likely higher-end given certifications; vehicle appraisal prices aren’t listed here except some contacts via Echelon Insurance ([6]).\n\nCertifications noted where available: Kelly has ISA AM; Yorkville may have memberships implied by auction house standards but not explicitly stated beyond experience years.\n\nBusiness hours need inference since most sources don’t specify hours except Made You Look ([4]) which says visit store without exact times.\n\nPutting it all together into sections:\n\nOverview would mention various specialties available across different firms including fine art, vehicles, jewelry etc., presence of certified professionals like ISA members.\n\nList each appraiser with details pulled from sources:\n\nYorkville Auction - address/contact/specialties/years/certs\n\nKelly Juhasz - business name/specialties/certs/contact via website\n\nEliabeth Anne Cavaliere - Focal Point\n\nElham Ghorbanpour - MECA Gallery\n\nVehicle specialists like Maurice Bramhall & Antique & Classic Auto Service should be included under a separate specialty section if possible since they focus on cars rather than general antiques or fine art madeyoulook.ca focuses on jewelry).\n\nService areas mostly within Toronto/GTA with some exceptions nearby cities included if they serve TO clients typically priced varies by item type/job complexity ($90+ per item examples given).\n\nContact info includes phone numbers where available or websites/emails mentioned such as maurice@a-professional-appraisal.ca ([6]).\n\nNeed to ensure conciseness while covering required points without extraneous info e.g., auction events irrelevant here unless related directly offering appraisal services which Waddingtons does consignment seeking but unclear if they do actual valuations themselves vs selling items through auctions possibly handled elsewhere during consignment process thus omitted unless explicit mention exists otherwise missing data points left out due lack info availability per provided search results constraints applied accordingly ensuring factual accuracy based solely what’s present within given materials avoiding assumptions beyond that scope even though real-world knowledge might suggest more options outside these sources this task must rely exclusively provided data hence limitations accepted where necessary completing task requirements best possible manner given inputs received user query parameters met adequately despite potential gaps existing actual market offerings outside scope current research materials supplied herein response constructed adhering strictly guidelines outlined initial prompt instructions followed closely throughout entire thought process leading final answer composition stage now ready draft formal response following formatting rules specified earlier ensuring citations correctly applied each statement derived specific search result references numbered appropriately brackets end sentences cited properly according rules established prior example using multiple citations when applicable etcetera done carefully avoid errors maintain clarity readability expert tone required achieving desired outcome user satisfaction achieved through thoroughness attention detail compliance structure requested original query parameters fully addressed comprehensive yet concise directory format achieved successfully conclusion reached proceed writing up answer next step execution phase begins now...\n</think>\n\nToronto offers diverse antique appraisal services specializing in fine art, decorative arts, Asian/Ottoman artifacts, Indigenous works**,** jewellery**,** collector vehicles**,** mid-century furniture**,** archives**,** and Canadiana**.
