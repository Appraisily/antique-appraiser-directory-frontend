      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Colorado Springs, Colorado based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. Alicia E Weaver (ISA CAPP) is mentioned in sources [1] and [2]. She's part of Prestige Estate Services in Denver. Her specialties include antiques, furnishings, decorative arts, and fine art. She has certifications like ISA CAPP and USPAP compliance. However, she's based in Denver but services the Front Range including Colorado Springs.\n\n2. Lisa W Duke (ISA CAPP) from source [6] operates LwDuke Appraisals in Cherry Hills Village, CO. Her service areas include Colorado Springs as well as Denver and Boulder. She has ISA CAPP certification and offers various appraisal services.\n\n3. Prestige Estate Services (source [2] and [5]) is located in Denver but serves Colorado Springs too. They have a team with ISA/ASA/AAA certifications.\n\n4. Busby Antiques (source [9]) is based in Casselberry, FL but their process might be similar for other locations? Not sure if they operate in CO.\n\n5.AppraiseItNow (source[10]) offers online appraisals but mentions they can do some items online except jewelry which needs an expert onsite; however not specific to CO Springs.\n\n6.Jewelry Appraisal service from source[7] is focused on jewelry via AGS Certified Gemologist Appraiser located in Denver; contact info provided but not sure if they cover CO Springs.\n\n7.Rug Care Specialists event mentioned Ellen Amirkhan as a certified appraiser for oriental rugs (source[8]), possibly available through ARCS events or referrals?\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor ([3]) discuss home appraisal costs generally but not antique-specific or local to COS.HomeLight ([4]) talks about comps for houses which isn't directly relevant here.\n\nSo compiling the list:\n\n- Alicia Weaver's Prestige Estate Services covers CO Springs.\n- Lisa W Duke also lists CO Springs as part of her service area.\n- Are there others? The Rug Care Specialist Ellen Amirkhan might be reachable through ARCS events or contacts.\n- Jewelry appraiser from source[7], though focused on jewelry could be included under specialties if applicable.\n  \nFor pricing: Source[3] gives general home appraisal costs ($300-$400), while specific antique services may vary; Prestige mentions affordable online options for one-offs ([1]). Source[9] mentions Busby Antiques' process but they're Florida-based so maybe exclude unless they have presence there? Probably not relevant here since no mention of serving Colorado specifically except their example uses FL locations.\n\nService areas: Both Alicia Weaver/Lisa Duke explicitly mention serving Colorado Springs along with other Front Range cities like Denver/Boulder etc., so those two are key entries here along with their companies' details from sources 1/2/6/.\n\nCertifications: ISA CAPP for both Alicia & Lisa; USPAP compliance noted too.Prestige team includes ASA/AAA members according to source[2].\n\nYears in business: Not explicitly stated except that Alicia was active by 2024 per her profile date ([1]), Lisa since 2013 per her member date ([6]).\n\nContact info available from their profiles‚Äîaddresses are listed as Denver/Cherry Hills Village respectively with phone numbers provided.Business hours aren't specified directly; likely need to contact them directly.Hours would typically be M-F 9-5 unless noted otherwise,but since it's not stated,might omit that part unless inferred somehow.Not much info on hours across any sources except maybe Jewelry Appraisal place has appointment times listed via booking links,but that‚Äôs separate specialty.So probably leave business hours as \"Contact for appointments\".\n\nNotable certifications besides ISA CAPP would include USPAP compliance mentioned multiple times,and IRS-qualified status at Prestige([1][2]).\n\nSpecialties:Alicia focuses on antiques,furniture,fine art.Lisa specializes similarly plus silver/decorative arts.Prestige overall covers Americana,Furniture etc.Lisa adds ceramics,silver,dinnerware etc.Rug specialists via Ellen Amirkhan could be another entry under oriental rugs perhaps?\n\nWait,the Rug Care Specialists event(source8) mentions Ellen Amirkhan who is a certified appraiser of oriental rugs(ISA & ORRA).She consults/expert witness.Her company isn't named there,but Robert Mann Rugs Inc.in Denver might collaborate?But contact info isn't clear.Maybe list her under Oriental Rugs specialty if possible.But without direct website or contact details beyond ARCS events,I'm hesitant.Including her might require more research than present data allows.So perhaps omit due lack of direct contact info within the given sources.Focus only on those explicitly listed with names,businesses,and contacts within the search results provided.Same goes for Jewelry Appraisal(source7)‚ÄîDenver-based so maybe optional inclusion under specialties section if needed,but user asked specifically about antique appraisers so jewelry may fall into personal property rather than antiques unless specified otherwise.User query says \"antique\" directory so perhaps focus only those dealing primarily with antiques/furnishings/decorative arts/fine art rather than specialized categories like jewelry unless integrated into broader antique services.Alicia does mention wine Victoriana etc.,so broader categories.Lisa includes silver,dinnerware,crystal which are collectible antiques.So both should suffice.For Rug specialists‚Äîmaybe note that some specialize further e.g.,Oriental rugs via ARCS-certified professionals available upon request?\n\nThus,the main entries will be:\n\n1.Prestige Estate Services/Alicia E.Weaver\n\n2.LwDuke Appraisals/Lisa W.Duke\n\nPossibly third entry:Rug Care Specialists/Ellen Amirkhan(if possible)\n\nBut given limited data,I'll stick to first two confirmed ones.Service areas confirmed include COS.Typical pricing can reference general ranges from HomeAdvisor($300-$400),but note that varies by item complexity/size.Prestige offers online one-offs at lower cost([5]).Lisa doesn‚Äôt specify prices.AppraiseItNow provides quotes based online submissions(source10),but again more generic.Could state starting around $85+ depending on item type(referencing Jewelry appraisal starts at $85 even though it's different category).\n\nPutting this all together into sections:\n\nOverview:Antique appraisal services available through certified professionals covering insurance,Estate,tax purposes.Notable firms serve Front Range including CoSprgs.Services range full estate evaluations single-item assessments.Certifications incl ISA,CAPP USPAP compliant,Pricing varies $85+ per item up several thousand complex estates.List top firms w/details.Contact each provider scheduling specifics/hours.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Colorado Springs  \n\n### Overview  \nColorado Springs benefits from access to certified professionals offering **antique**, **fine art**, **furniture**, and **decorative arts** appraisals compliant with IRS/USPAP standards.
