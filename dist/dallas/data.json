      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Dallas, Texas based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results. Result 2 mentions Prestige Estate Services in Dallas with over three decades of experience. They have ISA members and IRS-qualified appraisers. That's a good starting point for the overview section.\n\nResult 6 talks about Alicia Weaver from Prestige Estate Services being an ISA CAPP certified appraiser specializing in antiques and decorative arts. She's been around since 2010 according to result 3 (founded Prestige in 2010). So she should be listed as one of the appraisers.\n\nResult 7 mentions Brenda Blackmon at Prestige Estate Services focusing on furniture appraisals. So another specialist there.\n\nResult 5 has Ellen Amirkhan from Oriental Rug Cleaning Co., who is a Certified Rug Specialist (CRS) and does oriental rug appraisals. She's been in business since her family started it in 1911! That's over a century.\n\nResult 4 is Uptown Gold and Silver Exchange dealing with jewelry but not exactly antiques unless they handle antique jewelry too. The query specifies antique appraisers so maybe include them under specialties if they do antique jewelry?\n\nResult 8 lists Genice Lee as an ASA-accredited personal property appraiser in Dallas/Fort Worth area but doesn't mention antiques specifically; might not be relevant here unless her specialty includes antiques which isn't clear from the snippet.\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\nFor Prestige Estate Services: Alicia Weaver (founder), Brenda Blackmon are key names here with their specialties mentioned across results like fine art, furniture, etc., certifications like ISA CAPP, USPAP compliance.\n\nEllen Amirkhan at Oriental Rug Cleaning Co.: specializes in oriental rugs since 1911 (over century), CRS certification noted in result5 &7?\n\nUptown Gold: maybe under jewelry but if they handle antique pieces then include as well? Their result4 says estate jewelry buyers so perhaps yes for antique jewelry appraisal services.\n\nOther entries from result1 are Collin County REALTORS directory listing various appraisal companies like Thieman & Associates Inc., Firehouse Appraisals etc., but these seem more general real estate or personal property rather than specifically antiques except maybe some names there could be relevant? But without more info on their specialties towards antiques it's hard to say; perhaps omit unless explicitly stated elsewhere that they do antique appraisal which isn't clear here except possibly Cali Moore Appraisal or others listed there—but no specifics given so better stick to those clearly mentioned as handling antiques/art/furniture etc..\n\nService areas would generally be Dallas metro area based on addresses given (e.g., Plano addresses are part of DFW). Pricing: From result9 (Prestige) mentions $175-$225/hour depending on service type; Uptown Gold offers free initial evaluations per their site info which can be noted under pricing sections where possible contact info comes directly from each source—like phone numbers/addresses listed within respective search results entries when available such as phone numbers for Alicia Weaver’s company via prestigeestateservices.com links provided earlier...\n\nBusiness hours aren’t explicitly stated anywhere except maybe Uptown Bullion has contact times via phone/email—so might need to note \"varies\" or check individual websites when possible but since data isn’t present assume standard business hours unless specified otherwise...\n\nSo structuring this into sections:\n\nOverview: Highlight major players like Prestige leading with decades exp + others covering different niches e.g rugs/jewelry\n\nList each relevant firm/appraiser found above along required fields using available data points while noting missing info where necessary\n\nService Areas all cover Dallas TX metro region typically\n\nPricing ranges based on sources e.g $175-225/hr for some firms vs free initial consults elsewhere\n</think>\n\n**Antique Appraisal Directory: Dallas, Texas**\n\n---\n\n### **1.
