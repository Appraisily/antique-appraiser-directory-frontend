Let me start by going through the provided search results to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. Haney Appraisals in Fine Art (HAFA) is mentioned as a professional appraisal service based in Kansas City, specializing in fine art like paintings, prints, sculpture, etc. They cater to private and public collections globally [1].\n\n2. KC Auction & Appraisal Company offers free auction estimates and appraisals for items like art, coins, jewelry. They have been recognized as Best Auction House multiple times and sponsor events with KCPT [2].\n\n3. Dr. Lori provides video call and in-home appraisals with a focus on antiques and has a Ph.D. in art history [3]. However, her website doesn't specify she's based in KC but mentions an event there.\n\n4. BB Realty & Auctions has certified appraisers for estate sales and auctions [7]. They are based in Kansas City.\n\n5. The 2024 Kansas City PBS Appraisal Fair involved expert evaluations but is an event rather than a business [6].\n\nOther results mention Brass Armadillo (dealers who might buy antiques but don't do appraisals) [4], Valbridge Property Advisors (commercial property) [8], which aren't relevant here.\n\nNow compiling each section:\n\n**Overview**: The overview should mention the types of services available—professional appraisals for insurance, auctions donations—and note that some offer free estimates versus formal appraisals.\n\n**List of Appraisers**:\n- Haney Appraisals: Specializes in fine art; contact info from their site.\n- KC Auction & Appraisal: Offers free estimates; contact details from their site.\n- Dr Lori: Even though not explicitly based there she did an event there so maybe include her as available via virtual?\n- BB Realty & Auctions: Certified CAGA staff; contact info from their site.\n\nNeed to check if others like Valbridge or Busy Bee Ver are relevant—Valbridge does commercial property so no; Busy Bee Ver isn't found here except BB Realty which is covered.\n\n**Service Areas**: Most serve KC metro area unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Pricing**: Not much info except HAFA requires consultation; KC offers free estimates; Dr Lori's pricing isn’t listed here but typically charges fees per item or hourly.\n\nCertifications: HAFA likely has ISA or AAA? Not stated explicitly but they're professionals so maybe mention memberships if any? Wait HAFA's page says \"professional appraisal service\" without specific certs except years noted elsewhere?\n\nKC Auction mentions being voted best auction house multiple times which adds credibility even if not certifications per se.\n\nBB Realty mentions CAGA certified staff (Certified Appraiser’s Guild of America).\n\nDr Lori has Ph.D., museum experience—so notable certifications would be academic credentials plus media recognition.\n\n\nContact Info:\nEach entry needs business name address phone email hours etc.—but some sites may not list all details e.g., Haney's site shows location as Kansas City Missouri but exact address? Their website URL can be included instead if physical address isn’t present.\n\n\nPutting it all together concisely while adhering to formatting rules using headers lists citations where needed.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Kansas City  \nKansas City offers diverse antique appraisal services ranging from insurance valuations to auction-focused evaluations by certified professionals specializing in fine art furniture jewelry historical objects  \n\n---\n\n### Antique Appraisal Services Overview  \nServices include **insurance valuations tax-deductible donation documentation estate planning legal disputes auction estimates**.
