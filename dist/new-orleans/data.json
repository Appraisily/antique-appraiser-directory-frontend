      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed directory of antique appraisers in New Orleans. First, I need to gather all the relevant information from the provided search results.\n\nLooking at the search results, there are a few key sources. Result 10 mentions Sherry Kohlert of Kohlert Appraisals LLC. She has experience since 1991, specializes in jewelry, silver, antiques, and household contents. Her certifications include NAJA and AAA memberships. Contact info is available on their website.\n\nResult 2 talks about Prestige Estate Services which offers government asset appraisals but doesn't specify New Orleans location directly. However, they mention a nationwide network with IRS-qualified appraisers who follow USPAP standards. Maybe they have local appraisers in New Orleans?\n\nResult 6 is Busby Antiques offering home visits for appraisals but located in Casselberry, FL—not New Orleans. So probably not relevant here.\n\nResult 1 lists Le Garage Antiques and Clothing at 2112 Magazine St., New Orleans with contact info but doesn't mention appraisal services explicitly—maybe they offer it as part of their antique dealing?\n\nOther PBS results (3,5,9) are examples of appraised items but don't list local appraisers in NOLA.\n\nResult 4 is about religious archives' object evaluation which isn't directly related to commercial appraisal services.\n\nSo compiling the data: Sherry Kohlert seems like a solid entry based on result10's detailed info about her qualifications and services.\n\nPrestige Estate Services (result2) might have presence through their network; maybe include them as a national service with local availability?\n\nLe Garage Antiques (result1) could be included if we assume they offer appraisal services given that many antique dealers do provide such services even if not explicitly stated here—though that's speculative.\n\nNeed to check if any other entries mention NOLA-based professionals or businesses offering these services specifically within the city limits from other sources provided here... Doesn’t look like others do except possibly result8 which is Carmel Pine Cone real estate adverts unrelated to NOLA or antiques; result7 discusses home appraisal costs generally but no specific companies listed for Louisiana area either...\n\nThus main entries would be Sherry Kohlert from result10 and possibly Prestige Estate Services via their nationwide network mentioned in result2 even though exact location isn’t specified for NOVA area perhaps under service areas section noting coverage includes Louisiana or similar regions based on \"nationwide\" claim made by them earlier...\n\nAlso need overview section summarizing what’s typical for NOVA antique appraisal scene: mix of independent experts specializing different areas (jewelry vs furniture etc.), certifications required like USPAP compliance etc., pricing ranges can vary depending on item type/complexity... From HomeAdvisor cost guide (result7), average residential property appraisal runs $300-$400 range but antiques may differ so adjust accordingly using examples where possible e.g., Busby charges per item basis according to site content although located elsewhere yet gives idea structure-wise how pricing works when listing service fees...\n\nFor each listed appraiser:\n\n- Name/Business: Use names found.\n- Specialties: As per source descriptions.\n- Contact Info: Phone numbers/websites given.\n- Years Active: Based on start dates mentioned.\n- Certifications: NAJA/AAA/USPAP noted where applicable...\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in New Orleans  \n\nNew Orleans hosts specialized antique appraisers offering expertise across jewelry, fine art, furniture, and historical artifacts.
