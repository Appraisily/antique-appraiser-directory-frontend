      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in London, Ontario based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], there's a section for London with two entries: Prowse Appraisal Services and Paul Prince – Collector Vehicle Appraisals. Both have contact info and Paul Prince is listed under Collector Vehicle Appraisals. Also, Classic and Rod (Tom Muth) is mentioned for London/Toronto with contact details.\n\nSource [6] lists appraisers in Ontario but focuses more on vehicle appraisers. However, under GTA, there's Mark Cross P.A.V.E in Milton and Danny Kroll P.A.V.E in Toronto. Not directly London-based but might be nearby service areas?\n\nSource [9] mentions Ernest Johnson Antiques in Ottawa but that's outside London. Not relevant here.\n\nSources [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], and others discuss appraisal services elsewhere or general info but don't mention London specifically except for vehicle appraisals in source[1].\n\nSo the main antique appraisers in London from the data are:\n\n1. **Paul Prince – Collector Vehicle Appraisals**: Contact from source[1].\n2. **Prowse Appraisal Services (Jim Prowse)**: Also from source[1].\n3. **Classic and Rod (Tom Muth)**: Listed under London/Toronto.\n\nNow checking specialties: Paul Prince specializes in collector vehicles; Jim Prowse likely similar as it's under vehicle appraiser list; Tom Muth also classic cars via Classic and Rod.\n\nFor certifications, maybe \"PAVE\" certification is mentioned elsewhere? Source[6] has some with P.A.V.E., but not sure if applicable here unless specified.\n\nService areas would be primarily London, ON. Pricing isn't directly mentioned anywhere except maybe general notes like free valuations from other sources (e.g., OrientalAntiques), but not specific to these entries.\n\nBusiness hours aren't provided; need to note that they should be contacted directly for hours.\n\nNotable certifications: Need to check if any are members of organizations like ISA or ASA as per other sources (source[2]), but no explicit info here except possibly \"Collector Vehicle Appraiser\" titles which may imply specific certifications.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique & Collector Vehicle Appraisers in London, Ontario  \n\nLondon offers specialized appraisal services focused primarily on collector vehicles through established local experts with decades of experience.
