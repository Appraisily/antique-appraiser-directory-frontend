They want a detailed directory with specific sections: an overview, list of appraisers with their details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours. The response needs to be concise and factual.\n\nLooking at the search results provided:\n\n1. **Source [1]** mentions Citadel Gallery Auctions offering appraisals by Liz Isaac and Mario Brideau in Saint John, NB. Both are CPA members.\n2. **Source [5]** talks about Jardine Auctioneers in Fredericton specializing in vehicle/equipment auctions but doesn't mention antique appraisals directly.\n3. **Source [6]** references Kelly Juhasz as an accredited appraiser with ISA but based elsewhere (not explicitly Fredericton).\n4. Other sources ([2], [3], [4], [7], [8]) don't seem relevant to antique appraisers in Fredericton.\n\nWait, the user asked specifically for Fredericton, but Source 1 lists Saint John appraisers (Mario & Liz). Source 5 is Jardine Auctioneers in Fredericton but focuses on vehicles/equipment—maybe they do some antiques? The search result says they handle \"vehicles and equipment,\" so maybe not antiques specifically.\n\nKelly Juhasz (Source 6) is mentioned under Wall Fiction's news blog as a qualified art advisor and ISA member but located where? Her contact info isn't listed here except her website; perhaps she operates nationally or within New Brunswick?\n\nNeed to check if any other sources mention Fredericton-based appraisers.\n\nJardine Auctioneers (source 5) are definitely in Fredericton but might not specialize in antiques—maybe include them with a note on their focus area?\n\nSo possible entries:\n\n- Mario Brideau & Liz Isaac: Based on source 1; however, they're located in Saint John (not Fredericton). But maybe they service nearby areas including Fredericton? The query asks for service areas; if their business covers multiple regions including Freddy Beach that could work.\n\n- Kelly Juhasz: From source 6; her website fineartappraisalandservices.com might indicate she serves broader regions or has affiliations there?\n\n- Jardine Auctioneers: In Freddy but unclear if they do antiques—might need to include them with caveats about specialty.\n\nNow compiling each section:\n\n**Overview**: Antique appraisal services available through local specialists like Citadel Gallery associates (but those are Saint John), possibly Jardine handling some items despite primary focus elsewhere. Also note professionals like Kelly who may operate regionally.\n\n**List of Appraisers**:\n1. Mario Brideau & Liz Isaac - CPA members from Citadel Gallery Auctions (Saint John), specialties include art/furniture/silver/etc., contact info from source 1.\n   - Need to check if they serve Fredricton area even though based elsewhere.\n   \n2. Kelly Juhasz - Accredited ISA member via Fine Art Appraisal & Services; perhaps works across NB?\n   - Her site says president of Canadian ISA chapter so likely covers wider areas.\n   \n3.Jardine Auctioneers Inc.: Located Freddybut more into vehicles/equipment—maybe list under specialties as machinery/appraisal services?\n\nFor years in business: Source 5 says since1982 for Jardines.Mario/Liz’s years aren’t specified.Kelly’s profile doesn’t state it here.Certifications noted where possible.Service areas would be inferred from locations mentioned.Pricing isn't provided explicitly anywhere except general statements about competitive rates etc., so might have to omit specifics or state that pricing varies per item/complexity.Contact info available for some.Business hours not listed except phone numbers.So need to structure accordingly while staying factual based on given data.Acknowledge limitations where information isn't present.Focus only on what's present inthe sources provided without making assumptions beyond that.Final answer should list available data clearly under each required section.\n</think>\n\nFredericton offers access to professional antique appraisal services through local specialists and regional experts serving New Brunswick’s capital city:\n\n---\n\n## Overview  \nAntique appraisal services cover insurance valuations, estate planning/donation assessments (**Liz Isaac**, **Mario Brideau**[1]), machinery/equipment valuations (**Jardine Auctioneers**[5]), and fine art authentication (**Kelly Juhasz**[6]).
