Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours.\n\nFirst, I'll check the search results to find relevant information about antique appraisers in Minneapolis. The first result mentions Prestige Estate Services and their local antique appraisal services. They have ISA-certified appraisers like Alicia E Weaver (result 5). Another result (6) mentions Anoka Area Antique Appraisals with David Schlueter as a certified appraiser near Minneapolis. Result 10 talks about AppraiseItNow operating in Minnesota but isn't specific to Minneapolis.\n\nWait, Anoka is part of the Minneapolis metropolitan area? Yes, Anoka is a suburb north of Minneapolis. So David Schlueter's service would cover that area.\n\nLooking at Prestige Estate Services (results 1-3), they offer various appraisal options including in-person and online. Their team includes Alicia Weaver who has ISA CAPP certification (result 5). They specialize in antiques, furniture, art etc., which fits the specialties needed.\n\nResult 6 gives contact info for David Schlueter: Call or Text 612-412-1899. Business name: Anoka Area Antique Appraisals.\n\nAppraiseItNow (result10) offers online and some in-person services but isn't specifically tied to Minneapolis; however they operate statewide so can include them as an option with MN coverage.\n\nOther results like result7 mention an event in Duluth which is outside Minneapolis; result8 PDF seems unrelated except mentioning Carmel which isn't relevant here; result4 is about religious archives toolkit‚Äînot relevant here.\n\nSo compiling from available data:\n\n1. Overview: Mention key players like Prestige Estate Services and others found.\n2. List:\n   - Prestige Estate Services/Alicia E Weaver\n   - Anoka Area Antique Appraisals/David Schlueter\n   - AppraiseItNow as another option serving MN\n\nFor each entry:\nName/Business: Check names from results.\nSpecialties: From their descriptions.\nContact Info: Phone numbers/websites listed.\nYears in business? Not explicitly stated except maybe Alicia's member since 2012 (12 years?), but need to check dates‚Äîsearch results are from 2024/2025 so likely over a decade for her.\nCertifications: ISA CAPP for Alicia; David's certification mentioned but not specified which one; AppraiseItNow mentions USPAP compliance etc.\nService Areas: For Prestige/Alicia‚Äîlikely Twin Cities metro including Minneapolis since they have offices there? Result5 says \"service clients any location\" but focus on their presence there?\nAnoka Area covers parts near Mpls.\nPricing ranges based on service type‚ÄîPrestige offers photo valuations starting at lower costs vs comprehensive reports higher cost ($195+).\n\nNeed to structure all this concisely without markdown per user request but follow formatting rules using headers etc., while citing sources properly [1][2][3][5][6][10].\n\nCheck if any other businesses are present‚Äîmaybe only these three main ones found via search results?\n\nEnsure all info pulled correctly from sources without errors e.g., phone numbers correct from each source link provided?\n\nAlso note that some entries might not have full details like exact years or certifications beyond what‚Äôs stated so use available data accurately without assuming anything extra beyond what‚Äôs given.\n</think>\n\nHere‚Äôs a concise directory of antique appraisers serving **Minneapolis-St.Paul** based on verified sources:\n\n---\n\n## **Overview**  \nMinneapolis offers access to credentialed professionals specializing in antiques ranging from furniture and fine art to collectibles[1][2].
