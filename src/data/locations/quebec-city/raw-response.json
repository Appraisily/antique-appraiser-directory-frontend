Let me start by looking through the provided search results to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll check each source for mentions of appraisers in Quebec City. \n\nLooking at source [1], Pridham's | A.H. Wilkens operates in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto but doesn't mention Quebec City specifically. Source [2] is about the Canadian Antique Dealers Association (CADA) based in Toronto; they might have members in Quebec City but no direct info here. \n\nSource [3] is Inuit Sculptures Art Gallery offering appraisals for Inuit art at $340 CAD each, located online but not specifying Quebec City. Source [4] is a guide on starting an antique shop in Canada; maybe has general info but not specific appraisers.\n\nSource [5] from Canada.ca discusses tax implications for donating art/antiques and mentions CCPERB certification but no local appraisers listed. Source [6], Évolia Transition in Montreal offers inventory and appraisal services with CAPPA certification—Montreal isn't Quebec City but nearby.\n\nSource [7], Empire Appraisers serves Ontario and some Quebec communities like Montreal and Laval—again near QC city? Not sure if they cover QC city itself. Source [8], Bashir Carpets is based in Montreal with evaluations starting at $165 per carpet; again Montreal-focused.\n\nSources [9] seems irrelevant (text data), source[10] lists Pridham's Auctions & Appraisals operating out of Ottawa with no mention of QC city.\n\nHmm... none directly mention operating in Quebec City except possibly CADA members or those serving broader regions like Evolia Transition or Empire Appraisers might include QC city as part of their service areas even if based elsewhere.\n\nSince the user wants a directory specifically for QC city, I need to note that while there are limited direct listings within the sources provided, some nearby services may extend their coverage or there could be local professionals not captured here due to search result limitations.\n\nFor specialties: Inuit Sculptures specializes in Inuit art; Evolia does residential content including antiques; Empire covers art/antiques/furniture collections; Bashir focuses on carpets.\n\nCertifications: Evolia has CAPPA certification via Canadian Association of Personal Property Appraisers (source 6). Empire likely follows USPAP standards as mentioned (source 7). Bashir works with insurance agencies (source 8).\n\nPricing varies: Évolia charges based on items/appointment ($340 from source 3), Bashir starts at $165 per carpet plus travel fees if needed (source 8).\n\nContact info can be pulled from respective sources where available—phone numbers, emails, websites.\n\nSince explicit entries for QC city are scarce, I'll structure the answer by listing relevant companies that may serve the area or note proximity while advising checking professional associations like CADA for more options.\n</think>\n\nAntique appraisal services in Québec City primarily involve specialists offering expertise across fine arts, furniture collections, cultural artifacts**,** and decorative objects**.
