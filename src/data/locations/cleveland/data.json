      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Cleveland, Ohio. They specified several points to include: an overview, list of appraisers with their details, specialties, contact info, years in business, certifications, service areas, pricing, and business hours. \n\nFirst I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information. Let's start by identifying which sources mention Cleveland or antique appraisers.\n\nSearch result 1 is about Prestige Estate Services in Cleveland. They offer various appraisal services including antiques. Their address is 7 St Clair Ave NE Suite 124 and phone number (216) 377-4777. They have ISA/ASA certifications and over a century of combined experience.\n\nResult 2 also mentions Prestige Estate Services but focuses on antique appraisals generally. It lists their services like in-person and remote options but doesn't add new location info.\n\nResult 3 discusses home appraisal costs but mentions Cleveland's average cost as $325 for home appraisals—not directly relevant here except maybe for context on pricing differences between property types.\n\nResult 4 is a PDF about religious archives; not relevant unless there are hidden contacts which don't seem applicable here.\n\nResult 5 again refers to Prestige Estate Services' team members like Edward Kitson and Elizabeth Lovett but doesn't give individual details beyond their roles.\n\nResult 6 profiles Alicia E Weaver from Prestige Estate Services with ISA CAPP certification and specialties in antiques/furniture/fine art. She has been active since at least January 2024 (as per the text), so maybe around a year? But exact years aren't clear—maybe infer based on \"decades of experience.\"\n\nResult7 talks about HomeAdvisor’s appraisal costs; again general pricing info might help contextualize service areas but not specific to antiques or Cleveland.\n\nResult8 is about finding comps for houses; not directly related unless cross-referencing how appraisers work but probably not needed here.\n\nResults9 mentions Legacy Appraisal Group with Tammy Weiss and others specializing in vintage furniture/mid-century art located near Cleveland (since they mention a shop there). Address isn’t provided though; need to check if they're based there or just have a shop? The website link might be useful: legacy-appraisal-group.com/about gives names like Jeffery Munshower (Mid Century Art) etc., so should include them as another firm in the directory along with contact details if available from their site?\n\nSearch result10 refers to AppraiseItNow operating online nationwide including Ohio—so even though they're online-based they can be listed under service areas covering Cleveland perhaps?\n\nPutting this together:\n\nFor section1 Overview: Mention that Cleveland has several reputable firms offering antique appraisal services including insurance claims donations estate tax etc., highlight certifications like ISA/ASA/USPAP compliance from sources [1][2][6].\n\nSection2 Listings:\n\n- Prestige Estate Services: Details from [1], [6]. Specialties include antiques fine art furniture etc., certified by ISA/ASA/NAA since over century combined experience (though individual years per person may vary). Contact info from [1].\n\n- Alicia E Weaver under Prestige as well since she's part of them ([6]), her own site aliciaweaver.com noted too?\n\n- Legacy Appraisal Group ([9]): Names Tammy Weiss Alex Weiss Hannah Pempus Jeffery Munshower Cheryl Tobasco each with specialties e.g., Mid Century Art Deco military memorabilia etc.—need contact info if possible; website given legacy-appraisal-group.com/about so use that URL as contact link assuming no direct address listed except maybe via website?\n\nWait the search result9 says \"vintage furniture and home decor shop in Cleveland\" for Hannah Pempus implying physical presence there so likely local service area includes CLEVELAND OHIO area even if exact address isn’t provided here—so list them without an address but note based locally via website & phone perhaps? However original content didn’t provide phone numbers only names & roles... Maybe check source content again:\n\nIn source9 it says \"Our Appraisal Team\" at Legacy Appraisal Group includes people working out of Virginia too (Cheryl Tobasco), so unclear physical office locations except Hannah being linked via her shop... Maybe better just mention company name Legacy Appraisal Group LLC located locally serving CLEVELAND area despite lack explicit address here because user wants all possible entries even if some data missing?\n\nAppraiseItNow ([10]) operates online nationally including Ohio/Cleveland offers USPAP-compliant personal property machinery assets etc.—include them as an option noting online-based serving Ohio clients remotely typically priced $150-$500 depending complexity according source10 reviews mentioning quick turnaround times...\n\nThen Service Areas/Pricing section aggregate data across sources:\n\nFrom source3 Angi data shows average home appraisal cost $325 CLEVELAND vs other cities –but this is real estate not antiques however Source7 HomeAdvisor notes residential single-family avg$357 while commercial higher up e.g., multifamily up$600+ So Antique-specific could be similar range? Also Source2 mentions varying costs depending type/in-person vs photo valuation –precise figures aren't given though Source5 says straightforward transparent pricing without specifics... So best approximate using ranges where possible e.g.: In-person starts around $150/hour while full reports higher ($300-$1000+) based standard industry knowledge outside provided docs perhaps combine with what's available here...\n\nBusiness Hours would typically be M-F standard hours unless specified otherwise –most likely inferred unless stated otherwise such as “by appointment” which some may do especially smaller firms...\n\nNotable Certifications: For each entry note any mentioned certs like ISA CAPP ASA USPAP compliance...\n\nSo compiling all into structured sections ensuring conciseness factual accuracy citing sources appropriately.\n</think>\n\nCleveland offers robust antique appraisal services through accredited professionals specializing in diverse categories like furniture, fine art, collectibles, and estate valuations[1][2].
