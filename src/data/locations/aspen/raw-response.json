First, I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information about appraisers operating in Aspen.\n\nLooking at the search results, Alicia E Weaver from Prestige Estate Services is mentioned multiple times. Her profile on ISA's website [1] and her company's pages [2][6][9] indicate that she services Aspen among other locations. She has certifications like ISA CAPP and USPAP compliance, which are important credentials for appraisers.\n\nAnother mention is Brady L. Dreasher from the ISA directory [7], who lists Aspen as one of his service areas. His specialties include antiquities, art, carpets & rugs, etc., so he should be included.\n\nPrestige Estate Services [6][9] has a section mentioning their presence in Aspen under Alicia Weaver's leadership. They offer various appraisal services with specific pricing models (hourly rates and per-item fees). This info needs to be structured clearly.\n\nArt of Estates [10] also mentions servicing Aspen as part of their locations. They cover a wide range of personal property categories and have certifications like USPAP compliance.\n\nI need to ensure all listed appraisers have the required details: name/business, specialties, contact info, years in business (if available), certifications. For example, Alicia Weaver started Prestige Estate Services in 2010 according to result [9], so that gives her years in business since 2010 (15 years as of 2025).\n\nService areas are already given as Aspen for these entries. Pricing details are mentioned for Prestige Estate Services ($150-$300/hour; $25-$100 per item online) but not explicitly for others—so maybe note that pricing varies or requires consultation elsewhere.\n\nContact information: For Alicia Weaver/Prestige Estate Services: phone numbers from [1], email from [9]. Art of Estates uses a general contact number/email from their site [10]. Brady Dreasher’s contact is listed in result [7].\n\nNotable certifications should include ISA CAPP and USPAP compliance where mentioned.\n\nNow compiling all this into sections:\n\n1. Overview: Mention demand due to high-value estates and specialized needs; key players like Prestige Estate Services and Art of Estates operating there.\n2-3 List each appraiser/business with required details.\n4 Service Areas & Pricing: Aggregate pricing info found.\n5 Contact Info & Hours: Note business hours where available (e.g., Prestige offers online 24/7 but appointments needed).\n\nCheck if any other appraisers are present—looks like only those three main ones based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n**Directory of Antique Appraisers in Aspen, Colorado**  \n\n---\n\n### **1\\.
