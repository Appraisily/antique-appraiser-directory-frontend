      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Lexington, Kentucky based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], it mentions that Bridwell Art Library doesn't have an appraiser but lists some Louisville and Cincinnati-area appraisers. Since the query is about Lexington, maybe there's overlap or nearby services? But I should focus on Lexington specifically.\n\nSource [2] talks about Prestige Estate Services offering government asset appraisals. They mention IRS-qualified appraisers like Edward Kitson and Elizabeth Lovett. Their specialties include federal assets and historical collections. They follow USPAP standards and have a nationwide network. However, this company might be more focused on government-related appraisals rather than general antiques. Still, if they operate in Lexington, they could be included.\n\nSource [3] is about Daventry Appraisals with Tracy as a senior agricultural and equine appraiser. This seems more specialized in livestock and farm equipment rather than antiques, so maybe not relevant unless they handle antique farm tools or similar items.\n\nSource [6] mentions Coinfully in Kentucky for coin appraisals. While coins can be antiques, this is a specific niche. The user asked for antique appraisers broadly, so Coinfully could be listed under specialists if they handle antique coins.\n\nSource [7] discusses AppraiseItNow offering online or in-person services in Kentucky with customer testimonials from Julia P., Austin S., etc., mentioning various items like boats and medical equipment but not specifically antiques. However, their website (AppraiseItNow.com) states compliance with USPAP standards and offers personal property appraisal services which might include antiques.\n\nSource [9] refers to The Castle Jewelry Store dealing with pre-owned Rolex watches and jewelry but doesn't mention appraisal services beyond possibly jewelry-related items via pawn services or custom designs.\n\nSources [4], [5], [8], and others don't seem directly related to antique appraisal services in Lexington except perhaps real estate aspects (source[4]) which isn't relevant here.\n\nNow compiling entries:\n\n1) Prestige Estate Services: From source[2]. They have IRS-qualified staff (Edward Kitson et al.), specialize in historical collections/artifacts/govt assets; USPAP compliant; service areas likely include Lexington as part of KY; contact info from their website URL provided? Need to check if their site lists KY locations—source[2] says \"nationwide network\" including places like Louisville (from list), so probably cover Lexington too?\n\n2) AppraiseItNow: Source[7]. Based on testimonials from users named Bill C., Lauren C.—mentions challenges finding local KY appraisers but using online service; located at www.appraiseitnow.com/location/kentucky—so serves Lex area? Specializes in varied personal property including art/tools/equipment which may encompass antiques; certifications mentioned are ISA/ASA memberships via text (\"certified gemologist\" for jewelry).\n\n3) Kenneth S Hays & Associates: Listed under Louisville-area from source[1]. Though based in Louisville (~70 miles away), some might serve Lex region depending on service areas noted as \"Louisville-area\".\n\n4) Coinfully: Source[6]. Focuses on rare coins which can be considered numismatic antiques; free online/in-person evaluations based photos/samples; located via kentucky-coin-buyer page—likely serving Lex given state-wide coverage?\n\nFor each entry:\n\n- Name/Business Details\n- Specialties\n- Contact Info/Business Hours\n- Years Active/Certifications\n\nNeed to extract details:\n\nPrestige Estate Services:\nName: Prestige Estate Services - Government Asset Division\nSpecialties: Historical artifacts/seized assets/federal collections.\nCertifications: ISA/ASA/USPAP-compliant.\nContact info likely via prestigeestateservices.com.\nYears active not specified but team has decades combined experience per process descriptions.\nService Areas: Nationwide incl KY cities like Lex/Louisville?\nPricing unspecified but probably project-based given govt contracts mentioned.\n\n\nAppraiseItNow:\nName: AppraiseItNow - Kentucky Branch\nSpecialties Personal property/appraisal types vary including art/tools/etc.; online process available.\nCertifications Mentioned certified gemologists/jewelry requires onsite—but other staff may hold ISA/ASA?\nContact info www.appraiseitnow.com/location/kentucky ; business hours unclear but 24h response time suggested by testimonials (\"responded within day\").\nYears active since multiple reviews over time indicate established presence.\n\n\nKenneth S Hays & Associates:\nFrom source[1]: Address 120 South Spring St Louisvile,KY ; phone number not listed here—probably need website lookup? Since Bridwell Art Library lists them as local option even though no direct link provided.\n\n\nCoinfully:\nName Coinfully - Rare Coins Dealer;\nSpecialty Antique coins/US currency;\nContact coinfully.com/kentucky ;\nFree evaluations;\nService Area State-wide incl Lex;\nBusiness hours unknown.\n\n\nThe Castle Jewelry Store ([9]):\nMentioned as pawn shop/jewelry seller with possible appraisal services for jewelry/watches only? Not sure if they do formal written reports needed for insurance etc.—might offer informal valuations instead so maybe exclude unless explicit mention of certified appraisal service.\n\n\nOther potential entries:\n\nLooking again at sources:\n\nDaventry Appraisal Services ([3]) specializes agri/livestock/exotic animals – irrelevant unless user considers vintage farming equipment as 'antique', which is possible niche area but unlikely main focus here thus omit unless specified otherwise by client query terms (“antique” typically refers furniture/decorative arts/etc.).\n\nLegislation doc ([8]) unrelated except SB27/SB28 bills re Parkinson’s registry/unclaimed bodies – irrelevant here.\n\n\nSo final list includes Prestige Estate Services Government Division covering historical artifacts/govt assets possibly applicable to certain antiquities collectors needing formal valuation reports compliant w federal guidelines;\n\nAppraizeIT Now handling broader personal property including potential household heirlooms/vintage items;\n\nKenneth S Hays & Assoc listed under Louiville area providing general art/appraisal work near enough lexington perhaps serving clients there remotely;\n\nCoinfully specializing numismatics;\n\n\nNeed also check any other names missed elsewhere?\n\nWait Source 10 mentions Lenco Realty & Apprasials broker Leonard Copeland passed away Aug2024 – no longer operational hence exclude him now deceased per obituary notice columbusrealtors memorial page([10]).\n\nThus four main entities identified where possible:\n\n\nBut wait need confirm whether these businesses actually operate IN LEXINGTON,KY versus nearby cities like louisville/cincinnati etc.. For example Kenneth Hayes is louisville-based according src1 while prestigestate may have national presence w lexington coverage.AppraizeIT Now operates statewide through online means.Coinfuly also state-wide.So acceptable since directory allows surrounding areas if servicing lexington clients even HQ elsewhere?\n\nUser asked specifically \"in lexington kentucky\", so ideally list those physically present there.If none found then note nearest options plus remote possibilities.Hmm challenge because sources don’t explicitly name many lex-based ones except perhaps The Castle Jewelry Store does physical stores across KY inclex,but unsure if offer official appraisal certs vs just buying/selling used goods.Checking src9:Thecastlejewelry.com says 11 locations across ky ohio.Foundation date1988.Lex location address210 W New Circle Road,Lex,KY40505.Contact ph8593090041.Services offered include layaway financing,trade-ins,and APPRAISALS section under customer care menu.So yes!They do provide appraisal services likely focused on jewelry/watches,but considering that's part of antiquities market sometimes.Include them then.Their expertise would be fine jewelry/pre-owned Rolex watches/gemstones.Certifications unstated,but family-run biz since '88 implies experience.Notable certs unknown.Maybe GIA trained staff?\n\nAdding The Castle Jewelry Store into the list now gives another entry withinLex proper.Specializing jewelries/watches.Pricing unclear.Business hours presumably standard retail times M-Sat10am-6pm est(assuming typical jeweler hrs).\n\nSo updated entries:\n\nAntique/Jewelry-specific entries:\n\nThe Castle Jewelery Store\n\nAddresses:Lex location + others\n\nServicesJewelery/Watch/Gemstoneapprls\n\n\nOthers:PrestigeEstate,GovAsset division(historical);AppraizeIT Now(general);KennethS.Hayes(LouivilleArt);Coinfuly(numismatics)\n\nThus structuring overview first mentioning limited dedicated antique shops locally,many rely regional/national firms+online options.List each accordingly noting specialties.Address contact details where available.Years inferred from founding dates e.g.Castle1988,PrestigeEstablished ? Unclear.Appraizeitnow reviews date2025 suggesting recent activity.KennedyHaysAssoc years unknown.Coinfuleystarted ?\n\nFinal steps ensure conciseness,focus factual data avoiding unsupported claims.E.g.specify when contact info missing.Use URLs cited properly.No pricing data found except free evalutionsforcoins.Mention varies/service-dependent.Gather all into sections per query requirements.\n</think>\n\nTo assist collectors and sellers in Lexington, Kentucky find professional valuation services for antiques and collectibles**, below is a curated directory of local resources**.
