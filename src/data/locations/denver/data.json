      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Denver based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned multiple times. They offer antique appraisals as part of their services, have ISA certification, and are located in Denver with contact info. Their specialties include art, antiques, and personal property. They also mention service areas like Boulder and Aurora.\n\nSource [3] is another page from Prestige Estate Services detailing their antique appraisal process. They offer in-person, remote, and photo valuations. Pricing isn't specified but they mention competitive rates and providing quotes based on complexity.\n\nSource [5] again refers to Prestige Estate Services under their Denver office, reinforcing their certifications (ISA, ASA) and services including insurance appraisals and estate planning.\n\nMoving to source [6] and [7], these are about Neil Beaty at American Gem Registry focusing on jewelry appraisals. While jewelry is a type of antique, the user asked for antique appraisers generally. However, if they specialize in antique jewelry that's relevant here.\n\nSource [9] mentions Brady L. Dreasher from Art of Estates who does art and antique appraisals with multiple certifications (ISA CAPP etc.). He's associated with Anythink Libraries' events but has his own business details listed there too.\n\nOther sources like [8] talk about rug specialists but Ellen Amirkhan is a certified rug appraiser in Denver which could be included under specialties for rugs or textiles.\n\nNow compiling all this:\n\n1. Overview: The overview should mention key players like Prestige Estate Services as prominent providers covering various antiques; note specialized ones like Neil Beaty for jewelry or Ellen Amirkhan for rugs.\n2. List each appraiser:\n   - Prestige Estate Services: Multiple mentions across sources 1/3/5.\n   - American Gem Registry (Neil Beaty): Sources 2/6/7 focus on jewelry.\n   - Art of Estates (Brady Dreasher): Source 9.\n   - Robert Mann Rugs Inc.: Source 8 mentions rug cleaning but also might do related appraisal? Not sure; maybe Ellen Amirkhan works here?\nWait source 8 says Ellen consults as an expert witness for legal cases related to rugs so she's an independent certified rug appraiser linked with ARCS certification.\nNeed to check if Robert Mann Rugs offers appraisal services or just cleaning‚Äîsource doesn't specify beyond restoration services via ATC Turkey so maybe not directly offering appraisal?\n\nSo list:\n- Prestige Estate Services\n- American Gem Registry (Neil Beaty)\n- Art of Estates (Brady Dreasher)\n- Ellen Amirkhan Rug Appraisal\n\nFor each entry:\nPrestige has address from source 5:225 Union Blvd #150 Denver CO; phone number listed there too.(303)479-4970\nSpecialties: Antique furniture collectibles fine art etc., Certifications ISA ASA AAA IRS-compliant reports.Service areas Front Range Colorado including Boulder Aurora.Years since established?
