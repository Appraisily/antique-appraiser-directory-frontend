      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in St. Louis, Missouri based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and services.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **4 Old Guys Who Buy** (Sources 1 and 6): They are antique buyers with over 50 years in business since 1970. They specialize in buying militaria, jewelry, coins, antiques, etc., but do they offer appraisal services? The content mentions they have expertise in appraising but their main service is buying. Maybe they provide informal appraisals as part of purchasing items.\n\n2. **St. Louis County Historical Society** (Source 2): Hosts monthly antique appraisal events with Denny Mager of Northern Specialty. This is a free service but seems to be informal oral evaluations rather than formal written appraisals.\n\n3. **Artrium Appraisal** (Source 3): Based in Iowa but mentions serving regional areas like the Midwest and possibly St. Louis? Elizabeth is an accredited member of ISA with specialties in American/European art, estate jewelry, etc., and offers USPAP-compliant appraisals.\n\n4. **Coast2Coast Auctions** (Source 4): A St. Louis auctioneer that might have connections with appraisers or offer appraisal services as part of their auctions? Not directly mentioned here.\n\n5. **Prestige Estate Services** (Source 7): Offers government asset appraisals including personal property and art/antiquities; mentions nationwide network including Missouri locations like Kansas City but not explicitly St.Louis?\n\n6.**ISA Appraiser Directory**(Source8) lists members; check if any are located near St.Louis from entries shown: Cindy Stephenson(PA), Heidi Harders(Chicago), Diane Marvin(FL), Fred Winer(MD), Lennie Rose(NY/CT). None listed here are from MO based on page3 results provided—maybe other pages not included?\n\n7.**Bankrate & HomeLight**(Sources9-10) discuss home appraisal costs/comps which isn't directly relevant for antiques unless cross-referencing pricing models for personal property vs real estate—probably less useful here except maybe general pricing context if needed later when discussing typical fees section if info available elsewhere about personal property/appraisal costs from other sources like Artrium or Prestige which mention USPAP compliance which ties into standard practices/costs perhaps similar ranges ($300-$500+).\n\nNow compiling entries:\n\nFrom Source2: Denny Mager via Northern Specialty at Depot events—free informal oral IDs/evaluations during specified dates/times monthly at Depot location; third-party service through historical society partnership so should include him under list even though it's event-based rather than full-time business address perhaps?\n\nFrom Source3: Artrium Fine Art & Estate Appraisal led by Elizabeth who has ISA accreditation covering various arts/decorative fields including furniture/silver/jewelry etc.—though based IA may serve STL area given regional focus mentioned (\"regionalist movement\" includes Midwest artists).\n\nFrom Source7:Prestige Estate Services has nationwide network including MO presence per text \"strategic positioning...across different regions\" though exact STL coverage unclear; however their website URL linked might have more details not present here so assuming possible coverage given govt contracts likely span multiple states/cities within them especially major ones like STL metro area where federal agencies exist requiring asset valuations regularly enough for them having local contacts there potentially even if HQ elsewhere such as KC or other cities nearby...\n\nAdditionally Coast2Coast Auctions (source4) being local auctioneers could partner with independent certified professionals when needing formal valuations prior sales—so maybe refer clients out but no direct mention yet so unsure whether include unless inferred indirectly via industry connections without explicit data points supporting inclusion here...\n\nFor certifications noted across sources:\n- ISA Accredited Member (Artrium)\n- USPAP compliant reports required by IRS/Federal standards mentioned both Artrium & Prestige.\n- Antique Appraisers Association membership cited by '4 Old Guys' though unclear if that's a recognized body since primary role is buying not formal written documentation typically associated with professional appraisal organizations like ISA or AAA(Appraisers Association America).\n\nNow structuring sections per query requirements:\n\n1.**Overview**: Highlight key players found - mix between full-time professional firms vs event-based free options plus auction houses possibly facilitating valuations through partnerships albeit indirectly stated only via context clues perhaps better left out unless explicit info exists elsewhere confirming such links which current data doesn't show clearly enough beyond speculation thus focusing only confirmed entities from sources provided i.e., Denny Mager/Northern Specialty via Depot Events + Artrium + Prestige Estates + '4 Old Guys' as buyers offering informal assessments alongside others identified above...\n\nWait wait! Wait another look: The user asked specifically for antique APPRAISERS directory — meaning those who perform official valuation services for insurance/donation/estate purposes etc., NOT just buyers who evaluate items informally to make purchase offers... So need distinguish between businesses whose primary service is paid professional appraisal versus those who do evaluations as part of buying process without necessarily providing certified documentation required legally e.g., tax deductions donations require USPAP compliant reports done by qualified individuals accredited bodies such ASA/ISA memberships etc.. \n\nTherefore:\n\n- '4 Old Guys Who Buy' primarily buy antiques; while they may assess value during transactions these aren't formal written reports suitable legal purposes hence exclude them from list unless explicitly stated otherwise somewhere else within their materials stating they offer official appraisal services separate purchases – checking source6 again says \"Our expertise allows us to identify items...essential generating accurate cost effective assessments.\" But no mention certification nor offering standalone paid valuation outside purchase context thus likely NOT qualify under this directory’s scope despite being knowledgeable experts because lack credentials necessary produce binding documents needed institutions accept values claimed officially...\n\nSimilarly Coast2Coast Auctions facilitate sales but don’t state providing independent valuations themselves either way according given content snippets available here so omit too unless evidence exists otherwise missing current view into data presented now leads me think best leave out these two entities focusing instead on those clearly offering actual appraisal work professionally certified manner i.e.,Denny Mager/Northern Specialty working through Depot Events plus Artrium/Prestige Estates Services even if latter located outside immediate city limits yet serving regionally due client needs spanning wider areas than just one municipality alone especially larger metros where professionals often cover surrounding counties anyway making inclusion valid despite physical office locations being elsewhere nearby states sometimes depending upon demand patterns among clientele bases seeking specialized skillsets required handle unique collections requiring niche expertise found only certain practitioners regardless geography constraints sometimes apply less strictly today thanks remote consultations possible digital tools enabling virtual assessments more readily feasible post-pandemic era onwards…\n\nSo revised list candidates would be:\n\n1.Denny Mager / Northern Specialty – conducts free public appraisals at Depot events organized by historical society\n\n2.Elizabeth @Artrium Fine Arts – ISA-accredited covering wide range decorative arts/jewelry/furniture/etc.; based IA serves Midwest incl STL region presumably\n\n3.Prestige Estate Services – national firm w/MO presence handling govt assets also private clients needing USPAP-compliant reports\n\nPossibly others found via missing pages from source8’s ISA directory beyond page3 shown here since example shows up Lennie Rose NY/CT agents whereas actual STL-based ones might exist on other pages not included within current search result set provided… But since user instructed use only given sources cannot extrapolate beyond what’s present therefore proceed listing above three entries where applicable along noting limitations due incomplete data availability constraints imposed scenario parameters…\n\nNext step compile each entry details per query structure requirements:\n\nFor each entry need name/business details specialties contact info years operation certifications service areas pricing notes hours availability…\n\nStarting Denny Mager /Northern Specialty:\nName/Business:Denny Mager operates under Northern Specialty\nSpecialties:Militaria?, General antiques? Based event description he does “informal oral identification evaluation” suggesting broad range collectibles\nContact Info:Through St Louis County Historical Society events contact depot phone number?\nBusiness Hours:Specific dates third Wednesdays noon–3PM registration before230pm\nYears/Certs:N/A specifics mentioned except affiliation w/Northern Specially company name implying experience level unknown exact tenure \nService Area:Duluth MN? Wait no event location is Duluth MN according source2 text says “St.Louis County Depot Duluth” wait confusion arises because there's both Saint Louis city MO AND Saint Louis County MN… Checking original snippet [source2]: \n\n“The St.Louis County Historical Society will host Antique Appraisal events each month throughout2025 atStLouisCountyDepotinDuluth.”\n\nAh! Duluth,MN then?? Because SaintLouisCounty,MN includes Duluth whereas SaintLouisMOis separate entity entirely… So this would mean that DennyMager operates Minnesota NOT Missouri hence irrelevant user query asking specificallySTLMissouri directories!!! Oops critical error detected earlier assumption wrong!\n\nThus must exclude DenyManger entry entirely because his activity occurs Minnesota despite similar county name leading confusion geographical misplacement mistake made initially when processing information quickly without verifying exact locations properly first time around causing incorrect inclusion candidate now corrected upon closer inspection realizing discrepancy betweenSaintLouiscounties different states involved thereby removing him consideration altogether leaving remaining options limited indeed!\n\nTherefore remaining viable candidates after correction are only two left :ArtiumAppriasal& PrestigeEstateServices along any others hidden deeper within existing materials perhaps overlooked earlier passes over sources again carefully check all texts once more thoroughly ensure nothing missed inadvertently during initial scan phase…\n\nRe-examining Sources again looking potential entries missed previously :\n\nLooking back Source7(PrestigeEstateServices):\n\nTheir website URL indicates coastauctions.com domain suggests CoastAuction(s?) possibly same entity referenced Source4 named CoastAuctions.com which lists auctions held aroundSTL area implying physical presence locally therefor maybe having staff onsite capable performingapprasials independently although main focus seems selling estates rather than valuing them beforehand however text says “We can sell your real property at auction.” And mentions being local growing up there so likely connected community partners able refer clients trustedappriasiers when needed yet no direct mention employing own team certifiedprofessionlas themselves doingvaluation work internally thus probably rely external experts contracted case basis making hard confirm whether provide internalappriasialservices directly without further info unavailable present dataset necessitating exclusion until clearer evidence emerges supportingtheir
