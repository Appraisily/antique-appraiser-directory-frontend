      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Oklahoma City based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned multiple times. They offer antique appraisals and have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, and Stephanie Calman. Their services include in-person, remote, and photo valuations. They are ISA members and USPAP compliant. Contact info is available via their website or phone.\n\nSource [2] specifically talks about Prestige Estate Services in Oklahoma City. They list their services as estate tax appraisals, fine art, antiques, furniture, insurance documentation, etc. The team members are the same as above: Edward Kitson et al., with contact details provided.\n\nSource [3] discusses the antiques trade but doesn't mention specific appraisers in OKC.\n\nSource [4] is about home comps; not relevant here.\n\nSource [5] again mentions Prestige Estate Services but focuses on art appraisals; still relevant since they handle antiques too.\n\nSources [6], also from Prestige Estate Services details their antique appraisal process: three options (in-person/remote/photo), certifications (ISA/ASA), cost varies by complexity but no exact pricing given except that photo valuations can be quick and online options save money when possible.\n\nSources [7] gives home appraisal costs which might be somewhat useful for context but not directly applicable to antique appraising unless similar pricing structures apply—though this isn't specified here so maybe skip that part unless needed for comparison later on if other sources lack info—but since there's no data from others about prices except Princeton Library event ($20 per item), perhaps note typical ranges based on HomeAdvisor’s general figures adjusted for antiques?\n\nWait source[10]: Princeton Public Library event with Mark Moran charging $20 per item but it's a one-time event not an actual business in OKC so probably exclude that unless it's recurring or local—but location is Princeton Public Library which isn't Oklahoma City so irrelevant here?\n\nLooking at source[9]: Tulsa Antique Show Dealer List 2024 includes Tommy Davis from Oklahoma City listed under booth #92 as dealing with Native American jewelry & antique guns; Andrew Dingman Bixby OK general line antiques booth #34; others like Jana Stafford from Sparta MO etc., none seem based in OKC except Tommy Davis? Wait Tommy Davis is listed under \"Oklahoma City\" with specialties Native American jewelry & antique guns... So maybe he's an independent dealer who could offer appraisal services? But the context here is dealers at a show rather than professional appraisers—so unclear if they provide formal appraisal services or just sell items. Need to check if any mention of appraisal services by these dealers?\n\nIn source[9], under participating vendors: Tommy Davis (OKC) has booth #92 specializing in Yukon Oklahoma Native American jewelry & antique guns... No explicit mention of offering appraisals though some dealers might do informal evaluations perhaps? Since user wants professional directory entries only likely need certified ones like Prestige Estate team members who have certifications (ISA/ASA). So maybe only include them plus any others found?\n\nSo far main entries would be:\n\n1) Prestige Estate Services - Team members Edward Kitson Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman\n\n2) Maybe Tommy Davis as an independent dealer/appraiser if he offers such services? But search results don’t specify his role beyond being a vendor at Tulsa show selling items rather than providing official appraisals so probably exclude him unless more info exists elsewhere which there isn’t according to sources provided...\n\nOther possible entries: Source[8] Carmel Pine Cone PDF has real estate agent Rebecca Wolf Arnold mentioned but she’s focused on real estate not antiques so irrelevant here...\n\nThus primary entry seems to be Prestige Estate Services team based out of OKC area serving Edmond Norman Yukon etc., with contact details noted across sources especially 2 &6&5&1&etc.. \n\nNow compiling all data into sections:\n\nOverview section can summarize presence of local experts understanding market trends citing prestigeestate content about local knowledge importance ([1][2][6]).\n\nListings would focus on their team members' names business name specialties contact info years/certs – though exact years aren't given beyond \"decades\" experience ([6]). Certifications include ISA ASA USPAP compliance ([1][2][6]).\n\nService areas cover greater OKC metro including Edmond Norman Yukon ([2]).\n\nPricing varies by service type; photo valuations quicker cheaper while complex items require onsite visits costing more – average costs inferred from HomeAdvisor may range $100-$500+ depending ([7]), though direct examples aren't given except Princeton event $20/item which isn't applicable locally here).\n\nContact info includes phone number website address business hours possibly M-F 9-5 standard unless specified otherwise – specifics not detailed beyond “contact us today” links suggesting online availability plus offices across country serving efficiently([5]).\n\nNeed to structure answer concisely using headers lists tables where appropriate ensuring citations match sources used.\n</think>\n\nAntique appraisal services in Oklahoma City combine local market expertise with professional certifications to ensure accurate valuations for insurance, estate planning, and sales purposes.
