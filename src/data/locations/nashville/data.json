      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Nashville, Tennessee based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding the query requirements. The user wants an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the search results to identify all relevant antique appraisers in Nashville. From the sources:\n\n1. Prestige Estate Services (source 1 and 5) is mentioned as offering antique appraisals in Nashville.\n2. Redtail Appraisals (source 2 and 10) has Rebekah Assid as an appraiser with expertise in antiques.\n3. Busby Antiques (source 6) offers in-home antique buying/appraisal services but is based in Casselberry, FL‚Äîso not Nashville.\n4. Coin Purse (source7) deals with coins and currency; maybe not general antiques but included if they do appraisals.\n5. King Jewelers (source9) does jewelry appraisals; might be relevant if they handle antique jewelry.\n\nNext, for each entry:\n\n- **Prestige Estate Services**: They have multiple mentions across sources [1][5]. Their specialties include antiques, art, estate tax appraisals etc., USPAP certified, IRS qualified [1][5]. Contact info from source1: prestigestateservices.com/locations/nashville-tennessee/, phone number likely there? Business hours aren't explicitly listed but mention serving Brentwood/Franklin areas.\n\n- **Redtail Appraisals**: Rebekah Assid is ISA certified [2][10], specializes in antiques like furniture/porcelain/silver etc., contact via redtailappraisals.com [10]. Based on source2's about page‚Äîyears in business? Not directly stated but mentions experience since education dates might imply at least a few years.\n\n- **Coin Purse**: Source7 says they do coin/currency/gold/silver appraisal since 1968 [7]. Address: Nashville location on website coinpurse.com; business hours listed as Tue-Fri 10-5 Sat 10-3.\n\n- **King Jewelers**: Source9 focuses on jewelry/watches/antique jewelry appraisal [9], so maybe include under specialties even though primary focus is jewelry.\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor (8) are for Salt Lake City so irrelevant here; Bankrate (3), Homelight(4), others discuss home or general appraisal costs which may inform pricing section but not specific businesses.\n\nNow compiling each entry's details:\n\nFor Prestige Estate Services:\nName: Prestige Estate Services\nBusiness Details: Part of a national network with local experts\nSpecialties: Antique furniture, collectibles; USPAP compliant reports\nCertifications: USPAP standards compliance\nContact Info: prestigestateservices.com/locations/nashville-tennessee/, phone from site?\nYears Active: Not specified exactly but \"decades\" mentioned[1]\nService Areas:Nashville metro including Brentwood/Franklin/Belle Meade[1]\nPricing:Mentioned variable based on project type[5], photo valuations possible\n\nRedtail Appraisals:\nName:Rebekah Assid at Redtail Appraisals\nSpecialties:Furniture/porcelain/silver/vintage collectibles \nCertifications:Credentialed ISA member[2][10]\nContact Info redtailappraisals.com \nYears Active:Founded by Rebekah who has extensive experience per source2\n\nCoin Purse:\nName:Cion Purse \nSpecialties:Rare coins/currency/precious metals since1968[7]\nContact Info:Nashville location via website coinpurse.com \nHours:Tue-Fri10‚Äì5,Sat10‚Äì3\n\nKing Jewelers:\nJewelry-focused but includes \"antique\" pieces perhaps?\n\nWait Busby Antiques is Florida-based so exclude them despite being mentioned once for process example.\n\nNow service areas‚Äîmost cover Nashville metro unless specified otherwise like Coin Purse being local shop there.\n\nPricing needs to be inferred from available data.Source3 mentions home appraisal averages ($314-$423)[3] which isn't directly applicable here.Source6 talks about free assessments possibly.Busby's process may indicate that some offer free initial consultations.Prestige offers photo valuations which could be cheaper.In source5,Prestige notes costs vary by complexity and method(in-person vs remote)[5].\n\nPutting it all together into sections:\n\nOverview would highlight key players like Prestige & RedTail.Appraiser list entries need names,business details,certs,years active.Contact info where possible.Service areas mostly Nashville area.Pricing ranges estimated where possible,but specifics may not be available so note typical factors affecting cost(e.g., item complexity).\n\nNeed to check if any other businesses are present.Maybe King Jewelers does some antique-related work,but their main focus is jewelry.Worth mentioning under specialties?\n\nAlso ensure no duplication.Coin Purse handles coins specifically,might fit under specialty categories within antiques/different section?\n\nFinal structure should have concise entries per business,following user‚Äôs requested format.List as many as possible found through search results.Citations needed after each point using square brackets.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Nashville  \nNashville hosts several reputable antique appraisal firms specializing in estate planning insurance claims donations litigation support market analysis Notable professionals combine decades-long expertise adherence federal standards personalized service options  \n\n---\n\n### List of Antique Appraisal Professionals  \n\n**1\\.
