      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed directory of antique appraisers in San Jose, California. They specified several points to include: an overview, list of appraisers with their details, specialties, contact info, years in business, certifications, service areas, pricing, and business hours.\n\nFirst step is to go through the provided search results to find relevant information about antique appraisers in San Jose. Let's check each source:\n\n1. **Source [1]** talks about Mountain View US and Foreign Coins (San Jose Coin Appraisal & Rare Coin Buyers). They offer coin appraisal services with PCGS certification. Not exactly antiques but coins are collectibles which might overlap with antiques.\n\n2. **Source [2]** is about sports memorabilia appraisal services like PSA and Bob & Sally Connelly Appraisals. These are more sports-focused and not specific to San Jose or antiques.\n\n3. **Source [3]** mentions Valbridge Property Advisors for commercial property valuation‚Äîunrelated.\n\n4. **Sources [4]**, **[5]**, **[9]**, **[10]** discuss appraisal fees or unrelated services (like home appraisals) which aren't relevant here.\n\n5. **Source [6]**: BIS Appraisals does classic car appraisals in Northern California including San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento‚Äîmight be near San Jose but specializes in cars.\n\n6. **Source [7]**: Clars Auctions in Oakland offers appraisal services for various categories including furniture and decorative arts under their Furniture & Decorative Arts department; they also mention Trusts & Estates with Fair Market valuations etc.‚ÄîOakland is close enough to San Jose (about 40 miles), so maybe they serve that area too?\n\n7.** Source[8]** discusses land appraisal guides but not antiques.\n\nSo from the sources given:\n\n- Mountain View US and Foreign Coins (source 1) could be listed under numismatics/specialty items.\n- Clars Auctions (source 7) based in Oakland but might cover San Jose.\n- BIS Appraisals (source 6) does classic cars; perhaps include them as a specialty?\n\nBut the user asked specifically for antique appraisers‚Äîso generalists who handle furniture, art etc., not just coins or cars unless they do broader categories too.\n\nLooking at source 1 again: \"Our team provides detailed grading... extensive range of numismatic items.\" So coins primarily but maybe other collectibles? The page mentions \"numismatic items\" which can include medals or tokens but perhaps limited beyond that.\n\nClars Auctions' Furniture & Decorative Arts department handles American/European furniture from late 17th century onwards plus pottery/porcelain etc.‚Äîthis fits antique appraisal better even though located in Oakland; need to check if they service San Jose area since it's part of the Bay Area region mentioned by BIS Appraisals covering SF Bay Area/Sacramento etc., so possible coverage there?\n\nBIS Appraisal‚Äôs website says serving SF Bay Area including Monterey Bay/Sacramento/Northern CA‚ÄîSan Jos√© is part of SF Bay Area so likely covered by them for classic cars only though; unless their pre-purchase inspections cover other aspects? But probably just vehicles per source 6‚Äôs description (\"classic car\").\n\nAnother point: Source[7], Clars Auctions also has Asian Art department handling porcelains/paintings/textiles etc., Fine Jewelry/Watches section as well‚Äîso multiple departments that could handle different types of antiques even if based elsewhere nearby like Oakland/Berkeley area (~40 miles from SJ). Since users often look within metro regions even if slightly outside city limits when specialized services are needed especially for rarer items where few local options exist ‚Äî worth mentioning them as serving SJ area perhaps?\n\nNow compiling entries:\n\n**Mountain View US and Foreign Coins**  \nFrom source[1]:  \nName: Mountain View US and Foreign Coins / PCGS-Certified Rare Coin Buyers  \nSpecialty: Numismatic items (coins), authentication/grading/appraisal  \nContact: (415)952-6467  \nYears: Over14 years experience serving Silicon Valley/San Jos√© communities   \nCertifications: PCGS-certified  \n\nService Areas:Serves all parts of SJ including Alviso/Alum Rock/Almaden Valley/Evergreen/Santana Row/West/North/South SJ  \n\nPricing info isn't directly available here but typical coin appraiser fees vary per item ($50-$200+ per piece depending on complexity). Need to note this generically unless another source gives specifics ‚Äî none found here except HomeAdvisor's average home appraisal costs which don't apply here.\n\n\n**Clars Auctions**  \nFrom source[7]: Basedin Oakland CA (~40mi from SJ), serves entireBayArea likely includesSJ given proximity.Specializesin FineArt,Furniture&DecorativeArts(17thC+),AsianArt,Jewelry/Watches.Appraisaltypes:FairMarket/Insurance/Donation.Certificationsnotexplicitlystatedbuttheyworkwith estates/professionals implying credibility.Years:\"decadesofexperience\".Contactinfo via website clars.com.Businesshoursunknownbutauctionhouses typically M-F9-5.ServiceAreas:BroadlySFBayArea.Pricingwouldvarybasedonitemvalue/complexity.\n\n\n**BISAppraisals**(source6):Classiccarsonly,butifuserincludesvehiclesasantique then yes.Specialty:CertifiedUSPAP/IRS,DMAVINverifier.Contactbisapprasials.com.(408area code?)Wait,sourcedoesn‚Äôtlistphone number,buttestimonials show DMV licensing.Coverage:SFSacramento/MontereyBay/NorCal.Pricingfixedfeeplusmileage.No exact figures given.\n\n\nOther possible entries?
