Let me start by going through each source to gather relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at [1], Prestige Estate Services in Detroit has several appraisers: Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, Stephanie Calman. They offer services like estate tax appraisals, fine art, antiques, and insurance documentation. Contact info is via their website or phone. Certifications include IRS qualified and ISA members.\n\nSource [3] mentions Erika Holycross from Prestige Estate Services. She has a Master's in Fine Arts and is USPAP-compliant with ISA membership. Specializes in fine art, antiques, collectibles. Contact: 1-844-ITEM-VAL.\n\nIn [8], Catherine A Milewski is listed as an ISA Accredited Member in Roseville (near Detroit). Specializes in art, paintings, prints; works at Stefek's Auctioneers. Contact details provided: 20100 Cornillie Dr., Roseville.\n\nSource [6] from Prestige Estate Services again lists their services with pricing: $175/hour for non-regulated appraisals and $225/hour for IRS-regulated ones.\n\n[7] mentions Consolidated Appraisal Services offering online options but doesn't specify Detroit presence directly; might not be relevant unless they serve the area.\n\nBlack Dog Vintage ([4]) offers costume jewelry appraisals at $75/hour but located elsewhere? Wait no—checking URL domain says Black Dog Vintage MI (Michigan), so likely local to Michigan but not sure if Detroit specifically? The page title says \"Costume Jewelry Appraisals - Black Dog Vintage\" but without specific address; maybe include as a specialty service provider?\n\nOther sources like [2], [5], [9], [10] don't provide specific Detroit antique appraiser names or details needed for the directory.\n\nNow compiling:\n\n1. Overview: Mention key players like Prestige Estate Services and Stefek's Auctioneers serving Detroit with various appraisal services for antiques.\n2. List each appraiser found:\n   - Erika Holycross (Prestige)\n   - Edward Kitson (Prestige)\n   - Elizabeth Lovett (Prestige)\n   - Stephanie Calman (Prestige)\n   - Catherine Milewski (Stefek's)\n   - Black Dog Vintage if applicable\n\nNeed specialties and certifications from each entry.\nService areas should note Metro Detroit including suburbs mentioned like Dearborn.\nPricing from sources where available.\nContact info must be included without URLs unless specified; use phone numbers provided.\nYears in business can be inferred if possible—maybe mention experience levels instead since exact years aren't given except Erika’s transition after teaching which isn’t dated exactly.\n\nCheck duplicates: Prestige lists multiple team members; need to present them individually or as part of the company? Since user asked for individual names where possible better list them separately with their specialties if available else group under company entries with team members noted under same business details section when specifics are lacking per person beyond name only mentioned once perhaps?\n\nWait source[1] lists Edward Kitson et al., but no individual bios beyond being part of Prestige team whereas source[3] gives full bio on Erika Holycross who is also part of Prestige so she should be listed separately under her own entry within that company perhaps?\n\nSimilarly Catherine Milewski works at Stefek’s Auctioneers so separate entry there\n\nBlack Dog Vintage MI might have costume jewelry specialty even though address isn't clear—need to check URL again:\n\nURL is blackdogvintagemi.com/pages/costume-jewelry-appraisals — MI stands for Michigan so likely serving Metro area including Detroit maybe? But exact location not specified assume service area includes it since other entries cover broader regions around city proper\n\nSo final list would include:\n\nBusiness Name | Appraiser Names | Specialties | Certifications | Contact Info | Pricing \n\nBut user wants list as many antique appraisers as possible with their details per point 2\n\nThus structure sections accordingly:\n\nOverview first then list each professional/business entry bullet points under categories matching query requirements\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Detroit  \nDetroit hosts several reputable professionals specializing in antique valuations across diverse categories such as fine art, furniture, jewelry, and collectibles.
