      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Gurr Johns (Result 1)**: They mention a global network of 160 specialists and compliance with USPAP. While they have a presence in the US and UK, there's no specific mention of St. John's, NL.\n\n2. **ISA Appraisers (Results 2 & 4)**: Result 4 lists ISA members, including Stephanie A Daugherty and Holly Nelson ISA CAPP Certified Private Client Services in MN and NJ respectively—not St. John's.\n\n3. **BADA (Result 3)**: Lists members offering valuations in the UK but doesn't mention St. John's.\n\n4. **Carmel Pine Cone PDFs (Results 5 &9)**: These are local news from Carmel, CA—unrelated to Newfoundland.\n\n5. **Winter Associates (Result6)** is based in Connecticut; Turner Drake & Partners (Result10) has an office in St.John’s but focuses on commercial real estate valuation, not antiques.\n\n6.**Robert H.Baker(Result8)** is based elsewhere with no link to St.John’s.\n\n7.**Global Art Authority(Result8)** mentions Dr.Robert Baker but again no location info forSt.John’s\n\nWait,Turner Drake & Partners Ltd.(result10): Their website says they have offices includingSt.John’s,NL,but their services are commercial real estate appraisals.Not antiques.So maybe not relevant for antique appraisers?\n\nHmm.The user wants antique appraisers specifically.In the provided sources,there isn't any direct listing forSt.John’s,NL antique appraisers.Most results point to US or UK-based services except Turner Drake which is commercial real estate.So perhaps there are none listed here?\n\nBut wait,the query asks to create a directory using these search results.If there's no data,I need to state that.But maybe I can infer from broader companies like Gurr Johns having global networks?But result1 doesn't list specific locations beyond US/UK.Perhaps check if any other sources mention NL?\n\nLooking again at result3,BADA lists Peter Finer Ltd.in London.Runjeet Singh Ltd.in Warwickshire—no Canadian presence.Turner Drake is only one withSt.John’soffice,but not antiques.So it seems none of the provided sources list antique appraisers inSt.John’s,NL.This means I might have to indicate that information isn't available from given sources but suggest alternatives like checking local directories or contacting provincial associations since actual data isn't present here.\n</think>\n\n**Antique Appraisal Services Directory: St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador**  \n\n### Overview  \nNo direct listings for dedicated antique appraisal firms were found within the provided resources for St. John’s*.
