Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at search result [1], it's a PDF listing approved appraisers in BC. There are several entries for Victoria, like Coast Appraisals and D Fritz Appraisals. I should note their contact details and specialties if mentioned.\n\nSearch result [3] mentions Lunds Auctioneers & Appraisers Ltd., which is located in Victoria. They handle antiques and art auctions, so they likely offer appraisal services too. Their website URL is provided, along with contact info.\n\nResult [7] talks about Steptoe, which offers estate liquidation and appraisals. They're CPPAG accredited but based in King City? Wait, the address says 100 Airport Drive, King City—that might be outside Victoria. Need to check if they service Victoria or if there's a branch there.\n\nResult [9] from Antique Appraisers Auctioneers discusses ISA certifications and mentions Sotheby’s or Christie’s as auction houses with appraisal services but doesn't list specific Victoria contacts.\n\nResult [10] is about Brilliant Evaluations & Appraisals by Darlene Wong. She specializes in jewelry, watches, antiques etc., but her location isn't clear from the snippet—maybe Vancouver? The site URL is brilliantevaluations.com; need to check if she operates in Victoria.\n\nOther results like [2], [4], [5], [6], and [8] don't seem directly relevant to antique appraisers in Victoria specifically.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\nFrom source 1:\n- Coast Appraisals (Victoria)\n- D Fritz Appraisals (Victoria)\n- Berchard Appraisal Services (Victoria)\n\nFrom source 3:\n- Lunds Auctioneers & Appraisers Ltd., located at LiveAuctioneers.com but physical address might be Victoria based on their mention of being there.\n\nFrom source 7:\n- Steptoe mentions CPPAG accreditation but location might not be Vic; maybe they service the area?\n\nSource 10: Brilliant Evaluations by Darlene Wong—needs confirmation on location since her site says Vancouver Chapter for GIA Alumni Collective?\n\nNeed to verify addresses for each entry from sources to ensure they're actually located in Vic BC.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Victoria, British Columbia  \n\n### **Overview**  \nVictoria hosts several accredited antique appraisal professionals offering services ranging from insurance valuations to estate planning.
