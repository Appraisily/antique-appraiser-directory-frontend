      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in San Francisco based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant appraisers and their information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. Kelly Juhasz is listed in Toronto, so probably not relevant for San Francisco.\n2. Antique Appraisers Auctioneers mention Chinese antiques but no specific location.\n3. Jaime A. Corbacho is in Los Angeles, CA 90025 – that's LA, not SF.\n4. AppraiseItNow operates in California but doesn't specify SF; they offer online services.\n5. Siskiyou County Museum events – likely not relevant.\n6. Clars Auctions has an Asian Art department but located in Oakland? Wait, their website says Clars is based in Oakland which is near SF maybe?\n7. Turner Auctions + Appraisals are based in South San Francisco (94080), so that's part of the SF Bay Area.\n8. Jones Appraisal is explicitly mentioned as serving San Francisco and Marin County with real estate appraisals – wait, they do property appraisals for estates and divorce etc., not antiques specifically? Hmm maybe a stretch unless they handle personal property too.\n9-10: PBS Wisconsin and Carmel Pine Cone articles don't seem relevant.\n\nSo from this list, Turner Auctions + Appraisals (source 7) are located in South San Francisco and offer appraisal services alongside auctions.\n\nJaime Corbacho (source 3) is LA-based; Kelly Juhasz (source1) Toronto-based—so exclude them unless they service SF remotely? The query asks for service areas; if any mention serving broader regions or CA generally?\n\nAppraiseItNow (source4) offers online appraisals across California but isn't specific to antiques—though their specialties include collectibles and art.\n\nClars Auctions (source6) has an Asian Art department with specialists who do appraising; Clars is located nearby Oakland perhaps?\n\nJones Appraisal (source8): real estate focus but under \"About Us\" mentions personal property? Wait no—Jones does real estate only: \"We specialize in high-end properties...\". So probably exclude them as antique appraisal isn't their main service.\n\nTurner Auctions + Appraisals seems valid since they're physically present in South SF and offer appraisal services for various categories including Asian Arts, Decorative Arts etc.\n\nAppraiseItNow could be included if they have certified personal property appraisers operating remotely or locally within SF area.\n\nClars might be another candidate if located near enough to serve SF clients.\n\nLooking back at source6: Clars' website says \"Asian Art department's appraisers... CONSIGN NOW! Our team... attracting buyers from Asia...\" But where are they based? The URL suggests clars.com/departments/asian-art/, checking domain info: clars.com belongs to Clars Auction Gallery which according to quick check online is indeed located in Oakland, CA—close enough to serve San Francisco clients.\n\nSo possible entries:\n\n1. Turner Auctions + Appraisals\n2. Clars Auction Gallery - Asian Art Department\n3.AppraiseItNow\n\nBut need more details on each:\n\nFor Turner:\n- Name: Stephen G.Turner Associates / Turner Auctions + Appraisals\n- Address: 461 Littlefield Ave., South San Francisco\n- Contact: Phone number from source7: (888)-498-4450 \n- Specialties per source7 include Fine Arts, Decorative Arts, Asian Arts...\n- Years active since 2004?\nCertifications mentioned Stephen Turner as professional member of ISA perhaps?\n\nWait Source3 mentions Jaime Corbacho being ISA AM certified; Source1 also ISA memberships noted there but those individuals aren’t local here except possibly others via directories like ISA’s site which may have been sources here?\n\nBut given the user's search results only include these sources without other directories listing local ones like ASA chapters etc., limited data available here except what’s provided above.\n\n\nAppraiseItNow:\nFrom source4:\nThey connect with certified professionals across CA including ASA/ISA members per affiliations listed (\"leading professional organizations\"). They handle various assets including art/antiques/etc., starting price $195.\n\n\nClarifying each entry:\n\nTurner Auctions + Appraiser:\nName from LiveAuctioneers page as “Turner Auctions + Appraisal” founded by Stephen G.Turner since 2004.Specializes Fine arts.Decoratives.Asian arts.Toys.Jewelry.Militaria.Ethnic arts.Contact info address.SouthSF.CA.(888)-498-4450.Service areas would be primarily Bay Area.Pricing unclear,but auction house may charge percentage or flat fee depending on item.Appointment needed.Business hours unknown,but likely M-F standard hours.\n\n\nClarification needed on whether these entities actually perform formal USPAP-compliant written appraisal reports beyond auction estimates.For example,Turner provides auction estimates which can differ from formal insurance/donation purposes.But some auction houses do provide USPAP-compliant reports.If yes then include them.In Source7 description:\"appraisal consulting firm founded by2004\" implies proper appraisal services beyond just auctions.Stephen G.Turner Associates offers both auctions &appraisal consulting.Certifications would depend on his credentials e.g.,ISA member?Not specified here though.\n\n\nSimilarly for ClarsAuctions'AsianArt dept.:Their specialists can provide valuations/apprasials likely compliant with standards when required.They might have certified staff,but specifics aren't clear from given data.Needed certifications like ISA AM or AAA would add credibility.But without explicit mention,could note that expertise exists without certification details.\n\n\nAppraiseitnow.com lists working with ASA/AAA/ISA-certified pros.Since it's a platform connecting clients with experts across CA,pricing starts at $195,and process can be done online.They cover all asset types including antiques.Service area includes entire California so definitely covers SFO.Potential downside lack of physical presence locally unless paired with onsite visits when necessary(mentioned complex items require inspection).\n\nOther possible entries:Sources didn’t list others besides these three main options.Antique Textile section via AntiqueAppraiserAuctioneers(source2?)but no location specified.Perhaps general advice rather than specific firms.Include only those clearly operating within SFO vicinity or confirmed via sources provided.Now compiling into sections:\n\n\nOverview should summarize key players/services available.Pricing varies between platforms like starting at $195(Appr.It Now),auction houses may vary,Tuner possibly variable fees.List each entry under section2 accordingly.Notable certifications where known,e.g.Appr.It Now uses certified pros affiliated w orgs like ISA etc.Service areas mostly SFO/BayArea plus remote options.Hours vary by company,many require appointments.Contact info pulled directly from sources where available(e.g.Tuner phone number).Specialties per descriptions(e.g.Asian art,fine arts).Yearsin business:Tuner since2004,Jones over20yrs(but Jones focuses real estate),so Tuner=21yrs?,Clarssince ?
