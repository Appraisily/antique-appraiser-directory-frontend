      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Rochester, New York based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Schultz Auctioneers offers appraisals for antiques and other items. They are located in Western New York, Buffalo, and Rochester areas. Their specialties include antiques, jewelry, oriental rugs, lamps, furniture. Contact info is via their website form. Years in business aren't specified but they have a 2024 date on their page.\n\nSource [2] mentions Cottone Art Advisory & Appraisals in Syracuse but serves Rochester as well. They specialize in fine art and antiques with services like insurance valuations and estate assessments. Contact number is (585) 243-1000; established since 1985.\n\nSource [3] talks about Prestige Estate Services operating in New York City and upstate areas including Rochester. They do antique appraisals among others but don't list specific contact details for Rochester—maybe use the main contact info?\n\nSource [5] is JF Jones Jewelers in Rochester focusing on jewelry appraisals but mentions bringing experts for antiques etc., so maybe they partner with or refer to specialists? Their contact is via their website or phone.\n\nSource [6], Estate Pros offer personal property appraisals including antiques across NYS including Rochester area; USPAP compliant with over 15 years experience.\n\nSources like [4], [7]-[10] seem less relevant—[4] about rug care courses,[7] auction results,[8][9][10] not directly related to Rochester antique appraisers.\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\n1. Schultz Auctioneers: Antique specialties listed; contact via site.\n2. Cottone Auctions: Syracuse-based but serves Rochester since '85.\n3.Prestige Estate Services: covers Rochestermaybe use main number?\n4.JF Jones Jewelers: jewelry focus but mention handling other items through experts.\n5.Estate Pros: general personal property appraisal with USPAP compliance.\n\nNeed to check if all these are actually located in or serving Rochester specifically from the sources given.Source[6]:Estate Pros serve major cities including Rochestermso yes.Source[3]:Prestige serves Syracuse,Buffalo,Rochester etc.So include them even if based elsewhere?\n\nFor business details like addresses,Cottone has Manlius address near Syracuse,Prestige's location isn't clear beyond NYC presence.Estate Pros might be statewide without specific office listed for Roch—probably best to note service areas as \"Rochester area\" even if HQ elsewhere.Certifications:Cottone mentions ISA/ASA? Not sure from sources.Prestige says ISA/ASA/AAA certified.EstatePros uses USPAP standards.Years:Cottone since '85,EstatePros over15yrs,Jones Jewelry not specified years,but source date 2024-10-09 so likely current.Pricing info varies by service:Prestige doesn’t specify prices,EstatePros starts at $180 per item (from JF Jones),Schultz may vary.Cottage Auctions' process steps don’t mention pricing explicitly.Hours would typically be by appointment unless stated otherwise.Contact info should pull phone numbers where available (Cottone's (585)243-1000,Jones' site,EstatePros' site).\n\nNotable certifications:Prestige has ISA/ASA/AAA,Cottage maybe not specified beyond professional orgs.Each entry needs specialties,business name,years,certs,and contacts.I need to structure this into sections per query requirements.First an overview then list each appraiser concisely.Service areas mostly cover Rochestermetro.Typical pricing ranges where possible from sources e.g.,Jones starts at $180/item,Prestigue possibly variable,EstatePros may have different rates based on project size.Finally compile all into a directory ensuring accuracy based solely on provided data without adding external knowledge.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Rochester, NY  \n\nRochester offers access to professional antique appraisal services specializing in diverse categories such as furniture, fine art, jewelry, Asian artifacts, and collectibles.
