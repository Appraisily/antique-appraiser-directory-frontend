Let me start by understanding the query requirements. The user wants an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each search result to identify relevant antique appraisers in El Paso. \n\nLooking at [1], AppraiseItNow is mentioned as offering appraisals in Texas with online or in-person options. They have positive reviews from clients mentioning art and medical equipment appraisals. However, their website doesn't specify if they're based in El Paso or just serve the area.\n\nResult [3] talks about Bay Appraisals Jewelry in El Paso specializing in jewelry, including antique pieces recovered from the Titanic. They have certified gemologists and mention historical context evaluations.\n\nResult [5] is Susan Eisen's service page; she's a Master Gemologist Appraiser (ASA) and Certified Gemologist Appraiser (AGS) with 45 years experience in El Paso. She offers jewelry appraisals onsite or at home/vaults for an extra fee.\n\nResult [6] mentions Estate Sales and Appraisals El Paso providing personal property appraisals for antiques as part of estate planning/insurance.\n\nResult [7] is K.Jons Jewelry Co., which does official appraisals including antiques but requires items to be left for appraisal. They charge $200 per item but might not specialize solely in antiques.\n\nResult [9], Art Masters Of El Paso offers estate appraisals including antiques by a certified estate appraiser with fair market valuations.\n\nNow compiling each entry:\n\n1. **Bay Appraisals Jewelry**: Specializes in antique jewelry like Titanic-recovered items; certifications include accredited gemologists.\n2. **Susan Eisen Fine Jewelry & Watches**: Master Gemologist with ASA and AGS certifications; 45 years experience.\n3. **Estate Sales & Appraisals El Paso**: General antiques for estates/insurance.\n4. **Art Masters Of El Paso**: Certified estate appraisal expert focusing on assets including antiques.\n5.**K.Jons Jewelry Co.**: Offers antique jewelry appraisals but may require more time for research.\n6.**AppraiseItNow** serves Texas but not sure if based locally; included due to positive testimonials mentioning unique items like boats and art which could imply handling antiques.\n\nFor specialties: Need to note who does general vs specific (jewelry). Contact info from each source—some have phone numbers or websites listed (e.g., Susan Eisen has phone numbers from result[10]).\n\nPricing: K.Jons charges $200 per item ([7]), Susan Eisen has rush fees ([5]), others may vary but specifics aren't provided except Estatesaleselpaso.com might need checking their site (but no direct pricing found).\n\nService areas: Most are based within El Paso city limits unless stated otherwise like Bay serving surrounding areas (Horizon etc.).\n\nYears in business: Susan Eisen has 45 years ([5]), Art Masters since 2016? Wait result[9] says \"artmasters2016\" so maybe since 2016?\n\nCertifications noted where available: ASA, AGS for Susan; NAJA/USPAP compliance at K.Jons ([7]).\n\nNeed to structure sections clearly:\n\n- Overview first summarizing types available\n- List each business with required details\n- Service areas/pricing section\n- Contact info/hours\n\nCheck if any duplicates or missing entries—like Alliance Appraisal Services ([2]) are mentioned but they focus on vehicles/heavy equipment which might not fit 'antique' unless classic cars are considered... But user asked specifically for antique so maybe exclude unless specified as classic car specialty? Since Alliance does classic cars under Specialty section ([2]), perhaps include them as well even though location isn't explicitly stated as serving TX cities beyond NM/AZ/OK? Their website says trusted across NM,TX,AZ & OK so likely serve TX including EL paso?\n\nBut wait their URL is alliance-appraisal.com/services/, do they operate physically near EL paso? Not clear from data given—maybe better omit unless explicit mention of being located there?\n\nSimilarly HomeAdvisor list([8]) mentions Dallas TX pros but query is about EL paso so probably irrelevant here despite being top-rated elsewhere...\n\nSo final list includes:\n\nBay Appraisal Jewelry  \nSusan Eisen  \nEstate Sales & Ap...  \nArt Masters  \nK Jons  \nAppraiseItNow  \n\nWait also check result[10]: TripAdvisor review confirms Susan's location is EL paso TX address needed? From her site link([5]) it's susaneisen.com/services/jewelry... elpaso-austin/, implying she operates both places?\n\nNeed to verify addresses where possible:\n\nBay’s contact info includes Horizon,Socorro etc.—so local area around EL paso\n\nSusan’s page lists services elpaso/austin – likely main office there\n\nOthers like EstateSalesElPaso.com would be local\n\nArtMastersOfElPaso.com implies local presence\n\nAppraiseItNow’s base isn't clear—they work online/in-person across Texas possibly without physical office listed here \n\nSo structuring entries accordingly noting service areas even if some are online-based within TX/EL paso region \n\nBusiness hours need inference where possible e.g., K Jons requires appointments except when leaving items off without appointment – note that most will require contacting directly via phone/email since exact hours aren’t always provided except perhaps Susaneisen by appointment only \n\nPutting all together into concise sections ensuring all points addressed without markdown formatting yet\n</think>\n\nAntique appraisal services in El Paso cater to diverse needs such as insurance documentation, estate planning/resolution, historical valuation (e.g., Titanic-era artifacts), liquidation support**,**and legal proceedings**.
