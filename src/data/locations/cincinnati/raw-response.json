Let me start by going through each source to gather relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services in Cincinnati is mentioned multiple times. They offer various appraisal services like estate tax, fine art, antiques, and furniture. Their appraisers are ISA, ASA, or AAA certified and IRS qualified. Contact info isn't directly listed here but maybe found elsewhere.\n\nSource [2] also refers to Prestige Estate Services' antique appraisal process. They have three options: in-person, remote, and photo-based valuations. Pricing varies but they mention competitive pricing with quotes available.\n\nSource [4] talks about Caza Sikes offering free in-person art appraisals on Thursdays from 1-4 PM at their Cincinnati location. Graydon Sikes is noted as an expert there.\n\nSource [6] provides more details about Alicia E Weaver from Prestige Estate Services. She's ISA CAPP certified with over a decade of experience specializing in antiques and fine art. The business address isn't here but might be inferred from their website URL (prestigeestateservices.com).\n\nSource [7] gives Alicia Weaver's profile again with her certifications and specialties including Americana, furniture, paintings etc., contact via their website.\n\nOther sources like [3], [5], [8], [9], and parts of others don't seem relevant as they discuss home appraisals unrelated to antiques or memorials not related to appraisers.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services** comes up most frequently with multiple mentions of services (antique furniture appraisal), certifications (ISA CAPP), contact through their website.\n2. **Caza Sikes** offers free art appraisals on Thursdays.\n3. Check if there are others mentioned? Source[10] mentions ANTIQUES ROADSHOW event but no local appraiser listed beyond that episode's context which doesn't add a business entry for the directory.\n\nFor service areas: Both companies serve Cincinnati; pricing for Prestige varies based on service type while Caza Sikes has free valuations during specific hours.\n\nNotable certifications: ISA CAPP for Alicia Weaver at Prestige; Graydon Sikes' affiliation isn’t specified beyond being a partner at Caza Sikes but he’s featured on TV shows which adds credibility.\n\nYears in business: Not explicitly stated except Alicia Weaver’s profile mentions decades of experience so likely over 10 years for Prestige; Caza Sikes' years aren’t clear from sources provided so might omit that detail or mention \"established\" without specifics since it's not given.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Cincinnati  \n\nCincinnati offers specialized antique appraisal services through accredited professionals experienced in evaluating fine art, furniture, collectibles, and estate items.
