      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in San Antonio, Texas based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services** (source 3 and 6) is mentioned multiple times with locations in Houston and San Antonio. They have a team including Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, and Stephanie Calman. They offer various appraisal services like antiques, fine art, jewelry, etc., and mention certifications like ISA and ASA. Their contact info is available but specific business hours aren't listed.\n\n2. **AppraiseItNow** (source 2) operates in Texas with online services but mentions that jewelry can't be appraised online. However, they don't specify San Antonio specifically but might service the area.\n\n3. **Left Behind Antiques** (source 7) is directly in San Antonio and offers appraisal services for insurance, resale, etc., though details are limited beyond their contact page.\n\n4. **Association of Rug Care Specialists** (source 5) lists Ellen Amirkhan as a Certified Appraiser of Oriental Rugs based in Dallas but might service San Antonio given their Texas focus.\n\nOther sources like HomeAdvisor or Bankrate discuss home appraisals generally but not antique-specific ones in San Antonio.\n\nNext steps:\n\n- Compile all antique appraisers found specifically in San Antonio.\n- Extract business details from sources 3 (Houston page mentions servicing areas including New Braunfels which is near SA?), source 6 explicitly mentions SA.\n- Check if AppraiseItNow covers SA; source 2 says \"appraisals in Texas\" so possibly yes.\n- Left Behind Antiques (source7) is definitely SA-based.\n- Prestige Estate Services has a dedicated SA page (source6), so they should be included with their team members.\n- Ellen Amirkhan from ARCS might be relevant if she serves SA; her location is Dallas but maybe travels or does remote?\n\nFor each entry:\n\nName/Business: Need to list each company or individual appraiser found.\n\nSpecialties: From their service listings—antiques generally? Specific items like rugs?\n\nContact info: Websites/phone numbers from sources; note that Prestige's site has contact forms vs direct numbers sometimes listed.\n\nYears in Business: Not explicitly stated except Prestige mentions decades of experience collectively; Left Behind's website doesn’t specify years either.\n\nCertifications: ISA/ASA for Prestige staff; Ellen Amirkhan has CRS and ISA certs via ARCS; Left Behind doesn’t mention certs beyond offering appraisals.\n\nService Areas: For Prestige Estate Services—San Antonio area including surrounding towns as per source6 (\"New Braunfels...Texas hill country\"). Others may cover broader TX or just local SA?\n\nPricing: Source1 mentions costs vary by type ($195+), HomeAdvisor notes home appraisal averages around $357 but not sure about antiques specifically unless mentioned elsewhere. Source9 discusses home appraisal costs which isn't directly applicable here except maybe general ranges if no antique-specific data exists—maybe reference starting prices where available? For example AppraiseItNow starts at $195 according to source2 (\"pricing starts at $195\").\n\nBusiness Hours: Typically not listed on most sites except perhaps via contact pages requiring inquiry—so likely need to state \"contact for hours\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1.**Overview**: Highlight key players like Prestige Estate Services as prominent with multiple certified experts covering various specialties across the region along with others like Left Behind Antiques focusing on general antiques locally plus specialized rug appraisers possibly serving the area remotely/in-person occasionally.\n\n\nList entries:\n\n-Prestige Estate Services\n\n-AppraiseItNow\n\n-Left Behind Antiques\n\n-Ellen Amirkhan via ARCS\n\n\nEach entry needs name/business details pulled from sources.\n\n\nNeed to verify specialties from each source text.\n\n\nContact info must be accurate URLs/phones where possible.\n\n\nCertifications noted where present.\n\n\nService areas specified per company's coverage statements.\n\n\nPricing ranges inferred from available data points across different sources even if not exact matches since some are about personal property vs real estate—but better than nothing when needed for completeness while being transparent when estimates are made based on similar services elsewhere.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in San Antonio  \n### Overview  \nSan Antonio hosts several professional antique appraisal firms offering IRS-compliant valuations for insurance claims, estate planning/resale purposes ([1][3][6]).
