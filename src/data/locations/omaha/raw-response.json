      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Omaha, Nebraska based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. Prestige Estate Services (source 1) mentions they have a nationwide network of IRS-qualified appraisers and rapid response capabilities. They specialize in government assets but also mention handling antiques and art. Their website is https://prestigeestateservices.com/appraisals/government-property-appraisal-services/. They might have appraisers in Omaha since they mention a nationwide network.\n\n2. Antiques Roadshow (source 2) features an appraisal by Todd Weyman from Swann Auction Galleries in New York, but the event was in Omaha. However, this doesn't directly list an Omaha-based appraiser.\n\n3. Borsheims (source 4) is located in Omaha and offers jewelry appraisals but focuses on items purchased from them. They might not specialize in antiques broadly but could be relevant for jewelry within antiques.\n\n4. AppraiseItNow (source 10) connects users with certified appraisers online and mentions serving Nebraska, including Omaha specifically on their location page: https://www.appraiseitnow.com/location/nebraska.\n\n5. Auction Solutions Inc (source 7) offers appraisal services with certified experts but doesn't specify if they operate in Omaha.\n\n6.HomeAdvisor's cost guide (source5) provides pricing info which can be useful for section3 on typical pricing even though it's about home appraisals; maybe adjust for antique context?\n\nOther sources like YouTube video (8), Carmel Pine Cone PDFs(3,9), Mastercard PDF(6), etc., don’t seem relevant to antique appraisers in Omaha.\n\nSo compiling the list:\n\nFrom source1: Prestige Estate Services has a network that includes IRS-qualified professionals possibly covering Omaha; specialties include art and antiquities valuation with USPAP compliance.\n\nFrom source4: Borsheims does jewelry appraisals; contact info would be their store details although limited to jewelry bought from them unless older items are considered antiques?\n\nFrom source10: AppraiseItNow operates online connecting clients with certified professionals including those serving Nebraska/Omaha; specialties vary including fine art and collectibles; certifications mentioned are USPAP compliant etc., years not specified but testimonials suggest experience.\n\nAuction Solutions Inc isn’t explicitly linked to Omaha so maybe exclude unless inferred from service areas being national? But without specific mention of Nebraska or Omaha locations better not include unless necessary due lack of other options.\n\n\nSo possible entries:\n\n1.Prestige Estate Services - National firm with presence via network members.\n2.Borsheims - Jewelry focus.\n3.AppraiseItNow - Online platform connecting local experts.\nBut need more names... Maybe check if any others are implied?\n\nThe Antique Roadshow example had an event there but no local businesses listed except Swann Galleries which is NY-based so probably not applicable here except as example that events happen there sometimes.\n\n\nWait Source8 YouTube video mentions estate sales/flea markets shopping under $1in Midwest venues including one estate saleinOmaha,Nebraska where they found items like Noritake china set etc.,but this isn't about an appraisal service provider just resellers or buyers.So no direct help here.\n\n\nThus main entries would be Prestige,Borsheims,and AppraiseItNow as providers operating or availableinOmaha.Needto present these clearly noting their specialties,certifications,and contact info basedon sources given.\n\n\nFor overview section: Mention that Omahahas several options rangingfrom specializedjewelryappraisalsto broaderantique services throughnational networksoronline platforms.CertificationslikeUSPAPandISAare common.Pricing variesbasedonitem typeandcomplexitywith hourlyratesorper-item feescommon.\n\n\nService areas:Prestigemay coverOmahathroughnetworkmembers.AppraiseI tNow servesNebraskaincludingOmaha.BorsheimsislocalstoreinOma haforjewelry.TypicalpricingfromHomeAdvisorguide(source5)sayshomeappraisalavg$357butantiquemightdiffer.Source7(AuctionSolutionsInc)sayshourlyor perpiecefees.Source4(Borsheims):freeif originaldocs elsecharge,butnotspecificallyforantiquepieces.Maybementionrangeslike$100-$500dependingonscopeetc.\n\n\nContactinfoforeachbusinessasavailablefromtheirwebsites:Prestige’ssitehascontactpage,Borschaimsinfoishttps://www.borsheims.com/jewelry-appraisal/,AppraiseI tNow’ssiteishttps://www.appriveitnow.com/location/nebraska/.\n\nBusiness hours:Borschaimslikelyretailhours,Prestigeneedstobecontactedforappointments.AppraizeI tNewonlineplatformso24/7submissionsbutresponsetimesvary.Notablecertifications:PrestigehasIRSqualified/USPAP,AuctionSolutionsCertifiedAppraiserGuild/NationalAuctioneersAssociation,BorschaimshasGIAcertifiedgemologists.AppraizeI tNewusesUSPAP-certifiedexperts.Yearsinbusiness:Prestigesince2024?,Borschaimslongstandingstorelikelydecades(Appraisedvalueexamplefrom2015insource2?),AppraizeI tNewtestimonialsdate2025so relativelynewerbutexactyearsunclear.Needto phrasecarefullywhereinfoismissing.\n</think>\n\nHere's a concise directory of antique appraisal services available in **Omaha, Nebraska**:\n\n---\n\n## **Antique Appraisal Services Overview**  \nOmaha offers access to local specialists and national networks providing USPAP-compliant valuations for antiques, fine art, collectibles, and historical artifacts.
