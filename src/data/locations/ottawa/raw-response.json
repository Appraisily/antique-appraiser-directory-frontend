      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Ottawa based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info/business hours.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results. Result 1 is about Pridham's | A.H. Wilkens Ottawa. They mention auction services and appraisals but don't specify certifications or years in business beyond being established in 2011. Result 2 is Elizabeth Antique Appraisal Service; their website lists various appraisal services since 1965, which gives a long history. Result 3 is Spooner Auctions; they mention estate auctions but not much on appraisals beyond being experts in appraisal.\n\nResult 5 from BestInOttawa lists antique dealers but not specifically appraisers except mentioning some offer pricing services like Ottawa Antique Market and Champagne dit Lambert Antiques Ltd., which might do appraisals as part of their services. Result 6 mentions Pridham's Auctions & Appraisals again with reviews indicating good service but no certifications listed there.\n\nResult 8 is Ernest Johnson Antiques, part of CADA since 1989—so that's a certification (CADA) and years in business noted here.\n\nNow compiling each section:\n\n1. **Overview**: Need to summarize the types of appraisal services available—insurance, estate sales, government postings mentioned by Elizabeth Service (result2). Also note partnerships like Pridham’s with A.H.Wilkens expanding reach (result1).\n\n2. **List Appraisers**:\n   - **Pridham’s | A.H.Wilkens**: Established in2011 (from result1), specialties fine/decorative arts.\n   - **Elizabeth Antique Appraisal Service**: Since1965 (result2), various specialties including insurance.\n   - **Spooner Auctions**: Experts in estates/art/etc., no specific years found but result3 shows active auctions.\n   - **Ernest Johnson Antiques**: Member CADA since1989 (result8), specializes furniture/art/silver.\n   - Others from BestInOttawa: Aubrey’s has been around over30years (result5) so include them if they do appraisals? The entry says \"Antique Buy & Sell\" so maybe not explicit appraisal service unless implied.\n\nWait Aubrey’s entry under result5 says \"pricing services\" so perhaps they do offer appraisals as part of selling? Need to check if any mention explicitly—maybe under Services column it says \"Antique Buy & Sell\", which could include valuations for selling purposes.\n\nSimilarly Champagne dit Lambert accepts items for sale which might involve appraisal but unclear if formal service offered.\n\nSo perhaps list those who explicitly mention appraisal services:\n\nFrom search results:\n\n- Elizabeth Service\n- Pridham's/AH Wilkens\n- Spooner Auctions\n- Ernest Johnson\n\nOthers may be dealers offering informal evaluations when buying/selling but not dedicated appraisal firms?\n\n3.**Service Areas/Pricing**:\nElizabeth mentions written reports with photos/CDs (result2). Pricing likely varies per item; typical ranges aren't given except maybe $100-$300+ per hour or per item based on general knowledge since sources don't specify exact numbers except that some charge hourly rates or flat fees depending on complexity.\n\n4.**Contact Info/Business Hours**:\nEach entry should have contact details from their respective sources: addresses are available for most; hours vary by appointment or regular times like Ottawa Antique Market open daily until6pm etc., though some are appointment-only like Pridham’s.\n\n\nCertifications: Only Ernest Johnson mentions CADA membership; others may have USPAP compliance implied? For example Bob Connelly from Highland Mint link [9] talks about USPAP certification but he isn't located in Ottawa according to that source ([9] refers to US-based probably). So only local ones would be those mentioned above.\n\n\nPutting it all together concisely while ensuring all required elements are covered without unnecessary fluff.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Ottawa  \n\n### Overview  \nOttawa offers diverse antique appraisal expertise through auction houses and specialized firms catering to insurance valuations, estate planning, sales preparation (**market value assessments**), and government postings[2][6].
