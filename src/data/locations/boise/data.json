      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Boise, Idaho based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to identify relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results:\n\n1. **Prestige Estate Services (Result 1)**: They offer government asset appraisals with IRS-qualified appraisers. Mentioned specialties include personal property, seized assets, art, and antiques. They have a nationwide network but are based in multiple locations. Certifications include USPAP and ISA membership.\n\n2. **Idaho Pawn & Gold (Result 2)**: Provides estate liquidation services and mentions expertise in jewelry, coins, collectibles. Not explicitly an appraisal service but might offer evaluations as part of their services.\n\n3. **Antiques Roadshow episodes (Results 3,5,7)**: These mention specific appraisals in Boise but don't list local businesses except for Bonhams Skinner appraiser John Colasacco who was part of the show but based in Boston.\n\n4. **AppraiseItNow (Result 6)**: An online appraisal service that operates nationally including Idaho. They handle various assets and have certified appraisers with specialties like fine art and collectibles.\n\n5. **Boise Estate Liquidators (Result 9)**: Explicitly offers antique appraisal services as part of estate sales with experienced staff specializing in antiques, fine art, jewelry.\n\n6. Other results like Carmel Pine Cone or Washington State Bar News don't seem relevant here.\n\nNow compiling the directory:\n\n**Overview**:\nBoise has several options ranging from local firms like Boise Estate Liquidators to national services like AppraiseItNow operating locally. Services cover personal property to specialized items like art and jewelry with certifications such as USPAP compliance common among professionals.\n\n**List of Appraisers**:\n\n- **Prestige Estate Services**: Found in result 1; though not exclusively Boise-based they serve government agencies there.\n- Specialties: Art/antiquities.\n- Contact info isn’t directly provided but likely via their website.\n- Certifications: USPAP/ISA.\n  \nWait—the website is prestigeestateservices.com; contact info would be there but not listed here so maybe just note their presence without specifics if no direct address/phone is given?\n\nWait result [9] is boiseestateliquidators.com which lists local Treasure Valley service including contact details: info@..., phone number etc., plus specialties antiques/fine art/jewelry etc., years? \"Years\" isn’t specified but they mention being highly referred so maybe established?\n\nAppraiseItNow [6] works online/in-person; they have customer reviews from Idaho users so included even though online-based since they serve Boise area.\n\n\nSo entries would be:\n\n1.**Boise Estate Liquidators**\n   - Specialties: Antiques,fine art,jewelry\n   - Contact:(208)572-7253;info@bois...\n   - Service areas: Treasure Valley\n   - Certifications:Likely USPAP since mentioned professional standards\n\n2.**AppraiseItNow**\n   - Online/in-person\n   - Various specialties including collectibles,fineart\n   - Contact via website/appraiseitnow.com\n\n3.**Prestige Estate Services**\n   - National network includes Boize?\nTheir site says \"nationwide network\" so probably covers IDAHO too.Specializes govt assets,but also private perhaps?Certified IRS/USPAP\n\n4.Idaho Pawn & Gold may do some valuations for estates,but not sure if formal appraisal or just purchase offers.Maybe include them under pawn shops offering evaluations rather than certified appraisals?\n\nBut user asked for antique APPRAISERS specifically.So maybe exclude pawn shops unless they explicitly offer appraisal services.Idaho Pawn's page mentions free evaluations over phone/location for estate items—so possibly can be included as providing informal estimates rather than official reports.Certified?Not mentioned except XRF for gold testing.Maybe omit them unless required.\n\n\nService Areas/Pricing:\nFor Prestige,pricing aligns with federal contracts.Boise Est.Liquidators likely charge percentage or flat fee.AppraiseItNow has best-price guarantee,costs vary per item type.Typical pricing ranges aren't clear from sources except Appraisal fees could start around $100+ depending on complexity.\n\n\nBusiness Hours:\nMost will list standard hours e.g., M-F 9-5 or similar.Boise Est.Liquidators' site says free consultation available.Contact info varies by company.\n\n\nPutting it all together into sections per query requirements while ensuring only factual data from sources is used.Citations needed where possible.\n</think>\n\nHere's a concise directory of antique appraisal services in Boise based on available information:\n\n---\n\n### Overview of Antique Appraisal Services  \nBoise offers specialized valuation services through local firms and national networks covering personal property assessments to IRS-compliant documentation[1][6][9].
