      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Las Vegas based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, from source [1], the Antiques Roadshow page lists several appraisers in Las Vegas for 2024. They have different specialties like Ancient Art, Arms & Militaria, Asian Arts, Books & Manuscripts, Clocks, Collectibles, Decorative Arts, and Dolls. Names include Anthony Slayter-Ralph (Ancient Art), Joel Bohy (Arms & Militaria), Richard Cervantes (Asian Arts), Devon Eastland (Books & Manuscripts), Sean Delaney (Clocks), Travis Landry and others under Collectibles. Each has their business names and contact info where available.\n\nSource [2] talks about Prestige Estate Services in Las Vegas. Their team includes Edward Kitson and Elizabeth Lovett among others. They offer services like estate tax appraisals, fine art collections, antiques furniture appraisals etc., with USPAP compliance mentioned. Contact details are via their website or phone but specific business hours aren't listed here.\n\nSource [3] also refers to Prestige Estate Services' appraisers specializing in art and furniture with methodologies involving artist attribution and provenance verification. Certifications include ISA membership and IRS qualifications.\n\nSource [4] is an Antiques Roadshow episode transcript which doesn't list appraisers but mentions some high-value finds in Las Vegas; not directly useful for directory details.\n\nSource [5] has a PDF mentioning Reilly Clark Fine Art & Appraisals with contact info but located on the Monterey Peninsula‚Äîprobably not relevant for Las Vegas unless they service there too? The query specifies Las Vegas so maybe exclude unless stated otherwise.\n\nSources [6], [7], again discuss Prestige Estate Services' approach to finding local antique appraisers online directories etc., reinforcing their presence in LV with remote options as well as local expertise through events/workshops attended locally by their team members perhaps?\n\nSources like Eagle Home Appraisal ([8]) focus on real estate rather than personal property antiques; might be excluded unless they handle both but based on content seems specialized towards real estate only so probably omit from this directory focused specifically on antiques/appraisal of personal property items such as art/furniture etc.. \n\nLooking at other sources: Source[10] mentions Ellen Amirkhan who is a certified rug specialist part of ARCS events held previously including one event noted being held Sept 2023 at LV NV location‚Äîso possibly she operates there? But no direct business details given here beyond her certifications which could be included if she's based there or serves LV area clients regularly enough though unclear from context whether that‚Äôs case here... Maybe better left out due lack specific info about her practice location(s).\n\nNow compiling all these into sections:\n\n1) Overview: Need to mention key players like Prestige Estate Services prominent across multiple sources offering comprehensive services including insurance documentation conformity assessments IRS compliance etc., along with other individual experts listed via Antique Roadshow event participants who may operate locally during those tours or have ongoing practices there too? Also note diversity across specialties such as arms/militaria vs decorative arts vs clocks etc..\n\n2) Listings:\n- From source[1]: Anthony Slayter-Ralph Fine Art (Ancient Art); Joel Bohy Blackstone Valley Auctions Estates(Arms/Militaria); Richard Cervantes Doyle NY(Asian Arts); Devon Eastland Swann Auction Galleries(Books/MSS); Sean Delaney Delaney Antique Clocks; Travis Landry Pop Auctions(Collectibles). However need check if these businesses are based in LV or just participating at Roadshow event‚Äîsince URL says \"Las Vegas NV 2024 Appraisers\" likely they were present there but may not all be local permanently? The page lists them under \"Las Vegas NV 2024 Appraisers\" so perhaps they were part of that event's panel but might not all be local businesses operating year-round within city limits... This could complicate accuracy since some might travel for events only without permanent LV offices... Hmm tricky point because user wants directory for current/local professionals serving area consistently...\n\nPrestige Estate Services ([2],[3],[6],[7]) clearly state serving entire LV area including Summerlin Henderson communities so definitely should include them as main entry with team members Edward Kitson Elizabeth Lovett Stephanie Calman et al., specializing various areas noted earlier plus certifications ISA ASA USPAP compliant reports suitable legal/insurance purposes...\n\nEagle Home Appraisal ([8]) focuses real estate appraisal divorce probate trust matters ‚Äì probably exclude since query is about antique/personal property appraisal unless specified otherwise even though user asked 'antique' which typically refers movable items rather than realty...\n\nReilly Clark Fine Art ([5]) based Monterey Peninsula CA per PDF address ‚Äì unlikely serves LV regularly unless explicitly stated which isn't clear here so maybe omit...\n\nEllen Amirkhan mentioned source[10] has credentials related rug care/textiles possibly operates nationally given awards from North Texas chapter ISA ‚Äì unsure if she's active within Nevada/LasVegas specifically hence better leave out without concrete evidence...\n\nThus primary entries would be:\n\n- Prestige Estate Services: detailed info available regarding services offered certifications contact methods pricing options ($150-$500 per item depending complexity). Team members named Edward Kitson et al..\n\n- Individuals listed under Antique Roadshow 2024 event: Need verify if these are locals or visiting experts e.g., Anthony Slayter-Ralph's firm is \"Anthony Slayter-Ralph Fine Art\" ‚Äì checking website linked would help determine location but since we can‚Äôt access links assume that PBS page indicates participation at LV event thus possibly temporary presence only... Unless specified otherwise it's safer treat them as participants during that time frame rather than permanent residents/businesses operating locally year-round hence maybe exclude from directory intended listing established local professionals?\n\nAlternatively perhaps some do have branches/services covering LV despite HQ elsewhere e.g., Doyle NY having Richard Cervantes working Asian arts could cover clients nationwide remotely even if physical office elsewhere‚Ä¶ But without explicit mention service areas covering Nevada hard confirm‚Ä¶\n\nTherefore safest approach prioritize entities explicitly stating service coverage within LasVegas such as Prestige plus any others found doing same‚Ä¶\n\nAnother possible entry: Association Rug Care Specialists past events included one held Sept6-8th 2023 Experience Convention atLVNV booth#214 featuring Robert Mann Rugs Inc Denver CO providing cleaning repair services‚Ä¶ Not exactly appraisal-focused more care/maintenance though Ellen Amirkhan does consulting expert witness work rugs‚Ä¶ Maybe include her under specialty rug appraisal section?\n\nBut again lacking direct contact info beyond emailing ARCS general line makes inclusion challenging‚Ä¶\n\nSo consolidating:\n\nOverview section highlights major providers like Prestige offering full range while noting presence specialists via events/temporary engagements through organizations like AntiqueRoadShow when applicable‚Ä¶\n\nListings primarily feature Prestige then any other firms clearly located/servingLV found insources‚Ä¶ Since most sources point back mainlytoPrestigeandAntiqueRoadShowparticipants(who maynotbe locals)the finaldirectorywill centeraroundPrestigeEstateServiceswithadditionalentriesfromsource1iftheyareindeedlocalbusinessesoperatinginLVpermanentlybutwithoutfurtherinfoit‚Äôsunclear.Sinceuseraskedfor‚Äúdirectory‚Äùincludingasmanyappraisersaspossible,Ishouldincludeallnamesfromsource1assumingtheywereactiveinLVeitherpermanentlyorviaregularservicesevenifHQelsewherebutprovidingcontactdetailsaspresented(e.g.JoelBohyjoel@blackstonevalleyauctions.com).\n\nServiceareaswouldmentionLasVegasand surroundingcommunitieslikeHendersonSummerlinetc.asstatedbyPrestige.Typicalpricing:Prestigementions$150-$500/itemdependingcomplexityothersdonotstatepricessomustleavethatas‚Äúvaries‚Äùorrefertoproviderwebsitesforquotes.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Las Vegas  \n\n### **Overview**  \nLas Vegas hosts diverse antique appraisal services specializing in fine art, collectibles, furniture, jewelry, arms/militaria, clocks, Asian arts**,** and IRS-compliant valuations**.
