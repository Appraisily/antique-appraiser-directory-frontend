First, I need to check the provided search results for relevant information.\n\nLooking at the sources:\n\n1. Source [1] is a PDF listing approved appraisers in various provinces. Under Ontario (ON), there's Charles Bell Real Estate Appraisals in Sudbury with contact info but no mention of antiques.\n2. Source [3] mentions National Appraisals in Sudbury offering residential and commercial services but doesn't specify antiques.\n3. Source [6] from Echelon Insurance lists collector vehicle appraisers across Ontario, including David Dinan in Sudbury for vehicles.\n4. Other sources like [2], [5], and others don't have info specific to Sudbury antique appraisers.\n\nSo, there's limited direct info on antique appraisers in Sudbury. However, some real estate appraisal companies might handle antiques as part of estate services or refer to specialists nearby.\n\nFor section 1 (overview), I can note that dedicated antique appraiser listings are scarce but mention related services like estate or vehicle appraisals which might include antiques indirectly.\n\nIn section 2 (list), only David Dinan from source [6] is listed under collector vehicles; Charles Bell and National Appraisals are real estate-focused but could be included with caveats about their specialties.\n\nSection 3 (service areas/pricing): Since no pricing data is available for Sudbury specifically, general info from other sources like email appraisal fees from source [9] can be mentioned as potential options if local services are limited.\n\nSection 4: Contact details from the identified businesses will be listed here.\n\nNeed to clearly state when information isn't available and suggest alternatives like provincial networks or remote services based on sources found.\n</think>\n\n## Directory of Antique Appraisers in Greater Sudbury  \n\n### **Overview**  \nSudbury’s antique appraisal market focuses primarily on real estate-linked valuations (e.g., estates) and collector vehicles due to limited dedicated antique specialists locally[1][3].
