      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Charlotte, North Carolina based on the provided search results. Let me start by going through each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Prestige Estate Services is mentioned with team members Edward Kitson, Elizabeth Lovett, and Stephanie Calman. They offer various appraisal services like estate tax appraisals, fine art, antiques, furniture. Their contact info is 501 S College St and phone 1-844-378-7253. They are ISA members and IRS qualified.\n\nSource [2] also refers to Prestige Estate Services again but adds details about their process: in-person, remote, photo valuations. Certifications include ISA and ASA. Pricing varies but they mention competitive pricing with quotes based on needs.\n\nSource [3] compares evaluation vs appraisal vs liquidation but doesn't list specific appraisers in Charlotte.\n\nSource [4] seems unrelated—it's a chamber of commerce PDF with ads; no relevant info here.\n\nSource [5] talks about home appraisals via Triangle Appraisal Group but that's real estate; not relevant for antiques.\n\nSources [6], HomeAdvisor lists Raleigh pros but not Charlotte specifically for antiques.\n\nSource [7], Coinfully deals with coin appraisals in Charlotte (Wyatt McDonald) so maybe include as a specialty service?\n\nSources [8]-[10] discuss home comps or real estate appraisals again—not applicable here except Eagle Home Appraisal (source 9) which focuses on property valuations for divorce etc., not antiques.\n\nSo main entries are Prestige Estate Services team members from sources 1 & 2 and Coinfully from source7 as a coin specialist. Need to structure the directory accordingly:\n\nOverview: Highlight that Prestige is prominent offering various personal property appraisals including antiques; note specialties like IRS compliance etc., mention certifications like ISA/ASA.\n\nList each member under Prestige since they have multiple appraisers? Or list the company as one entry? The user asked for individual names if possible so split them into Edward Kitson et al., using details from sources 1 &2 where possible (years in business might be tricky unless inferred). Also include Wyatt McDonald from Coinfully as he's located in Charlotte per source7’s address (401 Hawthorne Ln).\n\nService areas: From source1 mentions covering Charlotte metro including Matthews etc.; pricing info says varies by type/size; hourly rates could be estimated from other sources? Source7 mentions $100-$250/hour for coins which might differ for general antique work but can note typical ranges if available elsewhere—maybe use generic \"starting at $150/hour\" if needed based on standard industry rates mentioned elsewhere?\n\nCertifications: For Prestige team ISA/ASA certified per sources1&2; Wyatt has ANA training noted in source7.\n</think>\n\n**Antique Appraiser Directory: Charlotte, NC**  \n\n### **Overview of Antique Appraisal Services**  \nCharlotte offers specialized antique appraisal services through credentialed professionals experienced in art, furniture, jewelry, collectibles, and IRS-compliant valuations ([1][2]).
