      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Calgary, Alberta. They specified several sections: an overview, list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided search results to find relevant information about Calgary-based appraisers. Let's check each source:\n\n1. **Search Result [2]**: Brian Lehman Evaluations offers stamp collection appraisals in Calgary.\n2. **Search Result [3]**: Same company (Brian Lehman) does retro toy appraisals.\n3. **Search Result [6]**: Brian Lehman also handles art appraisals.\n4. **Search Result [9]**: Talks about real estate appraisers in Alberta but not specific to antiques.\n5. Other sources mention other locations or services not in Calgary (e.g., Cowley Abbott is in Toronto).\n\nSo the main provider here is Brian Lehman Evaluations with multiple specialties: stamps, toys, art.\n\nWait, there's also Bears & Buds (Result 7) but Brenda Yenke is based elsewhere as the website isn't specific to Calgary.\n\nThe user wants as many antique appraisers as possible but from the search results provided only Brian Lehman comes up for Calgary.\n\nIn the overview section: Mention that while there are various online platforms for selling antiques (Result 1), local specialists like Brian Lehman offer accredited services across different categories.\n\nFor each entry under list:\n- Name: Brian Lehman Evaluations and Estate Sale Pros\n- Business Details: Found across multiple search results ([2], [3], [6])\n- Specialties: Stamps ([2]), Retro Toys ([3]), Art ([6])\n- Contact info might be on their website; since URLs are given but exact phone numbers aren't listed except \"Call now\" which isn't helpful—maybe infer from their site? Wait result 2 says \"We offer...appraisals in and around the Calgary area.\" So include contact details from their website URL provided? The URL is https://brianlehmanevaluations.com/ so maybe extract phone number from there? But looking at result 2/3/6 they all have \"Call now...\" without specifics—so perhaps note to visit their site or use contact form.\n\nYears in business aren't mentioned directly; need to check if any dates are present—search result 7 mentions March 2025 for Brenda Yenke but she's not in Calgary.\n\nCertifications: From result 2/3/6 they mention \"Accredited Appraisal Services\" so likely certified by recognized bodies like ISA or ASA?\n\nService Areas would be Calgary and surrounding areas based on their mention (\"in and around\").\n\nPricing info isn’t detailed except consignment fees on some other entries (like Love That Bag), which aren’t relevant here since those are resale platforms outside of appraisal services.\n\nOther potential entries? Check if Cowley Abbott has a presence—result 5 mentions a location in Toronto and possibly another phone number for Calgary (\"Calgary Phone: (587) 317-6564\"). They do Canadian art auctions; maybe they offer appraisal services too?\n\nLooking at result 5:\n\nCowley Abbott Auctioneers has a request valuation page (\"Request a Valuation\") so they might provide appraisal services for art specifically. Their contact includes a Calgary phone number even though based mainly out of Toronto.\n\nSo adding them as another entry:\n\nName: Cowley Abbott Auctioneers & Appraisers\n\nSpecialty: Canadian & International Art\n\nContact Info includes both Toronto and Calg numbers + website\n\nYears unclear; founded before Nov '24 when auction was held\n\nCertifications may include industry standards since part of auction houses often have accreditations\n\nService Areas likely national but with local presence via phone contacts\n\nAnother possible entry could be Bear Appraisal by Brenda Yenke (Result7), but her service seems online-based without specifying location unless she operates nationally including Calgarians can use her online service?\n\nBut user asked specifically for Calgarians so unless she has physical presence there it might not fit best practice here given data available – better stick only those explicitly mentioning serving Calgarian area per sources given i.e., Brain Lehmans & Cowley Abbotts' calgary line \n\nNow compiling all this into structured sections:\n\nOverview should highlight that options exist both locally through specialists like Brians covering various niches plus auction houses offering broader categories albeit possibly more focused on certain types e.g., fine arts via Cowleys \n\nListings then would include two entries:\n\n1.Brian Lehmans covering stamps/toys/art \nDetails pulled from Results[2][3][6]\n\nBusiness name same across these pages – same company offering multiple specialties \n\nContact info inferred as per URLs given – no direct address listed beyond being located near calgary area according Results[ ]\n\nBut wait Results[ ] state “We offer…in around calgary” so perhaps base office address unknown via data here – instead refer users to contact via website or call using numbers listed if any were present ?\n\nWait looking back at Search Result[9]: Real estate appraisal alberta article mentions nothing about companies just general occupation data - skip that \n\nThus final directory will have two main entities :Brian lehman evaluations(covering stamps/toys /art )and cowely abbott(art)\n\nNeed ensure formatting adheres strictly : concise factual bullet points tables where applicable etcetera avoiding markdown headers starting correctly with summary then sections using ## headers per format rules\n</think>\n\nHere’s an overview of antique appraisal services available in **Calgary**, Alberta:\n\n---\n\n### Overview  \nCalgary offers specialized antique appraisal services through accredited professionals focusing on niche categories such as stamps, retro toys, fine art/vintage collectibles (*stamps*, *Star Wars figurines*, *teddy bears*).
