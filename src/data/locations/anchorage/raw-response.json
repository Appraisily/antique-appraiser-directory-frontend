Let me start by reviewing each source to extract relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at search result [1], Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals is mentioned as the #1 Auction House in Alaska. They offer estate sales, business liquidations, appraisals, and have been around since 2018. Their contact info is (907) 570-7050 and they're located at 325 W Potter Drive. They have certifications like USPAP compliance mentioned in other sources.\n\nResult [5] talks about Duane's Antiques in Anchorage. The owner is Duane Hill who's retiring after over 40 years. The store has a wide range of items but it's unclear if they do formal appraisals or just sales. However, since he's liquidating inventory now (as of Jan 2025), maybe they still offer some services.\n\nResult [9] mentions AppraiseItNow which operates online but serves Alaska. They provide various appraisal services including personal property and real estate with certified appraisers. Their contact info isn't specific to Anchorage but they are available there online.\n\nOther results like [3], [6], [7], etc., reference Antiques Roadshow episodes with Nick Dawes and others doing appraisals in Anchorage but these are likely one-time events rather than local businesses.\n\nSearch result [2] discusses Prestige Estate Services which offers government asset appraisals nationwide including IRS-qualified appraisers with USPAP standards. Though not explicitly based in Anchorage, their network might include local professionals.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. **Alaska Premier Auctions & Appraisals** from result [1]: clear details here.\n2. **Duane’s Antiques** from result [5]: even though retiring, may still be operational until sale.\n3. **AppraiseItNow** from result [9]: national service covering Anchorage.\n4.**Prestige Estate Services** from result[2]: national network possibly including local experts.\n\nFor specialties: Need to check each entry for what they cover—Alaska Premier does estates; Prestige does government assets; Duane’s has general antiques; AppraiseItNow covers various assets via online service.\n\nContact info: Use addresses/phones where available or note online presence for others like AppraiseItNow and Prestige that may not have physical offices locally but serve the area remotely or through networks.\n\nYears in business: Alaska Premier since 2018; Duane’s over 40 years until retirement; Prestige doesn't specify years but mentions experience with federal contracts; AppraiseItNow has client reviews dating back indicating established service.\n\nCertifications: USPAP compliance noted for several (Alaska Premier mentions USPAP via context from other sources). IRS-qualified for Prestige’s team members as per their site ([2]).\n\nService areas should mention that some operate statewide or nationally but based locally (Anchorage). Pricing varies by project—some charge hourly ($100-$200), flat fees ($250+), percentage-based (for auctions).\n\nNeed to ensure all data points are covered concisely without redundancy while keeping factual accuracy based on sources provided.\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of antique appraisal services in Anchorage:\n\n---\n\n### **Antique Appraisal Services Overview – Anchorage**\nAnchorage offers specialized appraisal services through auction houses and certified professionals focusing on estates, fine art, historical artifacts, jewelry/collectibles, and government assets ([1][2][9]).
