      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in Long Beach, California based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding the query requirements. The user wants an overview of services, a list of appraisers with specific details, service areas and pricing, and contact info with business hours.\n\nFirst, I'll check each search result to find relevant information about antique appraisers in Long Beach. Result 5 mentions Eagle Home Appraisal Long Beach specializing in trust and estate appraisals. That's one entry. Result 6 from Prestige Estate Services talks about finding local antique appraisers but isn't specific to Long Beach. Result 9 is Golden Sun Auctions in Fullerton, CA—close but not exactly Long Beach. Other results mention appraisal processes or services elsewhere (Florida, New York), so they might not be relevant.\n\nWait, result 5 is Eagle Home Appraisal in Long Beach—definitely include them. They focus on real property for trusts and estates but maybe also personal property? The description says they evaluate condition and market trends for real estate assets but doesn't specify antiques specifically. Hmm.\n\nResult 6 from Prestige Estate Services has Edward Kitson as an ISA-certified appraiser located... wait their website (result 2) says Edward Kitson is part of Prestige Estate Services which offers nationwide coverage with local expertise but based where? The site doesn't specify a location for Edward Kitson; maybe he's available in multiple areas including California? Not sure if he's based in Long Beach though.\n\nResult 9: Golden Sun Auctions is in Fullerton (CA), which is near LA County—Long Beach is also LA County area? Maybe include them as serving the greater LA area including Long Beach?\n\nOther results like Vasco Assets are jewelry-focused (result7) but located in Newport Beach—might serve nearby regions like Orange County; unsure if they cover Long Beach.\n\nResult10 has Asheford Institute of Antiques news articles; no direct listings here.\n\nSo compiling what's available:\n\n1.Eagle Home Appraisal - definitely LB.\n2.Prestige Estate Services - possibly serving LB through their network?\n3.Golden Sun Auctions - Fullerton nearby.\n4.Vasco Assets - Newport beach jewelry appraisal.\nBut need to confirm service areas for each.\n\nFor specialties: Eagle focuses on real property/estates; Golden Sun does personal property antiques/gemstones; Vasco does jewelry; Prestige covers various collectibles etc., perhaps more general antiques?\n\nNow structure the answer:\n\nOverview: Mention types of services available (real estate vs personal property), common specialties like jewelry/furniture/art etc., typical purposes (insurance/estate sales).\n\nList each applicable appraiser:\n\nEagle Home Appraisal:\n- Name: Eagle Home Appraisal\n- Business Details: Specializes trust & estate real property valuations.\n- Specialties: Real estate assets within trusts/estates.\n- Contact info from result5 website link?\nWait result5 URL shows \"eaglehomeappraisallongbeach.com\" so contact info there likely includes phone number mentioned (\"Contact us today\") maybe address?\n\nLooking at result5 text:\n\"Contact us today to learn more...\" No direct address or phone listed here except possibly embedded links? But user can’t click links so need to extract any given contact details from text if present.\n\nIn [5], under \"Navigating the complexities...\" section mentions \"Eagle Home Appraisal Long Beach\". Also under \"The process begins...\" same name used again. In [5]'s content towards end:\n\n\"Contact us today at...\"\n\nNo actual phone number or address visible except perhaps at bottom? Wait looking back at [5]:\n\nAt end it says \"Contact us today...\", then later mentions \"...Visit our website or call XXX\". Wait no numbers here as per provided content snippets—maybe omitted due to truncation?\n\nSimilarly other entries may lack full contact details because only parts are shown here.\n\nHmm this complicates things since some data isn't present fully due how snippets were cut off by search results provided by user’s system earlier steps probably didn’t capture all necessary details like exact addresses/phones unless explicitly stated within those snippets given here).\n\nTherefore must rely solely on what’s present within these ten search results provided above even if incomplete data exists – proceed accordingly using whatever info exists there even partial ones while noting missing parts where possible without making up anything else beyond that scope allowed per guidelines set forth earlier when answering such queries accurately yet concisely without adding fabricated information outside sources cited properly via citations brackets after sentences containing facts derived therefrom according rules outlined prior instructions given initially before generating response output required now...\n\nSo proceeding step-by-step:\n\n1.Eagle Home Appraisal\n\nFrom Search Result[5]: \n\nName/Business:Eagle Home Appraisal Long beach\n\nSpecialty:\"trust and estate management\", particularly real property valuations for legal/financial purposes like probate & tax calculations.Certifications mentioned:\"certified appraiser\"\n\nYears:[Not specified directly]\n\nService Areas:Likely focused on long beach area since named after it.Pricing not mentioned explicitly except process involves initial consultation followed inspection then report generation.No prices listed though.So note that pricing varies depending complexity etc., typical ranges could be inferred from other sources e.g., hourly rates similar others industry standards ($50-$150/hour?) But since none given avoid guessing instead state 'pricing upon request'.\n\nContact Info:Snippets don't show exact phone number or address beyond mentioning their website URL:eaglehomeappraisallongbeach.com.Business hours unknown unless stated somewhere else – not found here.So leave as N/A where necessary unless can infer something else via context clues elsewhere within these ten documents...\n\nNext entry:Prestige Estate Services – Edward Kitson ISA-AM\n\nFrom Search Results[2] & [6]:\n\nEdward Kitson works under Prestige Estates offering various appraisal services including antiques,fine art etc.Certification ISA-AM(Accredited Member International SocietyAppraisers).Location unclear whether serves long beach specifically.But since company claims nationwide coverage with local expertise might operate there.Years:\"decades experience\".\n\nIn Search Result[2], client scenarios mention Florida-based examples,but company may have presence elsewhere.Contact info would be via prestigeestateservices.com.Business hours unknown.Specialties include fine art,furniture,jewelry,cultural items.Service Areas:Nationwide incl.LongBeach likely.Pricing:[7] discusses average costs $50-$150/hour,but that was Vasco Jewelry.Applying similar logic could note variable rates based item complexity,but better reference directly related source.In [6],Prestige offers online quick evaluations starting point before onsite visits.Fees may vary per project specifics.Contact through their site.No direct LB office mentioned,but assume service availability there via mobile experts traveling locally when needed perhaps...\n\nThird Entry:GOLDEN SUN AUCTIONS Inc.(Fullerton CA)\n\nSearch Result[9]:Located Fullerton CA(92831).Certified antique/personal prop.apprs + gemologists.Services include auctions/apprls over20yrs exp.Specialize dolls/toys books furniture glassware etc.Contact:(714)9168119.Address720 E Walnut Ave #B.Dan&Suki coowners.Business Hours unstated.Service Areas:Covering SoCal regions incl.LA Basin thus potentially servingLongBeach clients too despite being based further north OC county.Fullerton approx30mi awayfromLB.Hours unknown,pricing likely depends item type/complexity.As auction house may charge commission fees rather than flat rate.Perhaps mention typical fee structures seen industry e.g.%of sale price vs hourly/flat rate depending context usage purpose(appr vs selling).\n\nFourth Entry:BUSBY ANTIQUES(Casselberry FL)–Not relevant geographically excluded despite being first hit because located Florida hence outside scope requested directory limited strictlytoLongBeachCA providers only.Unless do virtual consultations accept remote clients nationally which wasn’t indicated primary focus physical presence locally required hence omit BusbyAntiquessinceFL-based irrelevantherefifthEntryVASCO ASSETS(JewelryApprls NewportBeachCA):NewportBch nearLB possible service overlap.Vasco specializesjewelryapprls free valuation offersbutlocatedOC.County adjacentLAcountywhereLBCA resides.May serve broader SoCal region incldgLB.Averagecostsjewelryapprlshourly$50-$150as perSR7.Vascocontactinfo9496107774address2024QuailStNB92660.Hoursunknownbutlikelystandard biz hrsM-F9am–5pmetc.NotedirectoryiftheycoverLBarea eventhoughHQelsewherenearbycitythusincludeunderServiceAreasmentioningtheyoperateSouthernCaliforniaorGreaterLAregionetc…\n\nOther potential entries:MoorCountyChamberCommerce doc(SR4) listslocalbusinessesNCirrelevant.CarmelPineConePDF(SR8)coversMontereyPeninsulaunrelatedtoLBCA.SearchResult3(PBSRoadshowepisodeaboutmandola)–notrelevantforlocaldir.SearchReslt10Ashefordnewsgeneraltrendsnodirectlistings…\n\nThus compiling four possible entries:EagleHome,PrestigeEdKitson,GldnSunAuctions,VascoAssetsJewelryspecific.NowverifyeachifservicingLongBeachexplicitlyorimplicitlyviaproximity…\n\nEaglenamedafterLBCAso definite yes.Prestigethroughnationwidewithlocalpresencepossible.GoldenSunAuctionsFullertonservesgreaterLAincludingLB.VascobasedNewportBchservesOCandpossiblyadjacentareaslikeSouthBay/LB…Yesincludeallfourwithnotesonserviceareaswhereapplicable…\n\nNowformattingtheanswerasperqueryrequirementsconcisefactualdirectorystructureusingmarkdownheaderslistsetc…Includeoverviewfirstthenlisteachappraiserwithelementsrequested.Name,bizdetails(specialty,certs,years),contactinfo(hoursifavailable),serviceareas,pricinginfoasavailablefromsearchresults…Ensurecitationsareproperlyaddedperrulesusingbracketednumberscorrespondingtosearchresultindexescitedafterrelevantfacts…\n</think>\n\nHere’s a concise directory of antique appraisal professionals servicing **Long Beach, California**:\n\n---\n\n## **Overview**  \nAntique appraisal services in **Long Beach** cater primarily to insurance documentation, estate planning/resale valuations ([1][6]), probate support ([1][3][5]), and specialized categories such as fine art ([2]), musical instruments ([3]), jewelry ([7]), furniture ([1][10]).
