Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at source [1], Conrad Jewelry Company is mentioned as a top antique jewelry appraiser in Tampa Bay. They have decades of experience and are led by Ron Conrad. Their specialties include jewelry appraisal with USPAP compliance and ISA membership. Contact info is available via their website or phone, operating by appointment only.\n\nSource [2] and [6] mention Prestige Estate Services, which offers online and in-person appraisals. They have Erika Holycross (source [3]) as an expert appraiser with ISA certification and USPAP compliance. Alicia Weaver (source [8]) is the president here, expanding their reach nationwide including Tampa. They handle various antiques like furniture, art, collectibles.\n\nSource [4] from Sarasota Antique Buyers discusses appraisal processes but doesn't list specific Tampa appraisers. Source [5] has Englewood Chamber contacts but seems unrelated to antique appraisal except for Lemonde Valuation on page 43 mentioning real estate appraisals in Englewood—maybe not relevant here.\n\nSource [7] is a YouTube video about Dr. Lori appraising antiques but mentions Tampa; however, no direct business details are provided beyond her website which might be outside the scope since it's not explicitly listed as a local service.\n\nNow compiling the list:\n\n1. **Conrad Jewelry Company**: Specializes in jewelry with Ron Conrad leading since 1998.\n2. **Prestige Estate Services**: Through Erika Holycross and Alicia Weaver's team; they cover multiple specialties including furniture and art.\n3. **Lemonde Valuation** from source[5], page 43: Listed under real estate but might do estate valuations? Not sure if they handle antiques though.\n4 Need to check if there are others... Maybe Dr Lori from source[7], but contact info isn't clear here except her website DrLoriV.com—might be national rather than local?\n\nWait also check sources again for more names:\n\nIn source[9], Prestige Estate again mentioned for furniture appraisal; no new names beyond what's already noted.\n\nSo main entries would be Conrad Jewelry Co., Prestige Estate Services (Erika & Alicia), maybe Lemonde? But Lemonde seems focused on real estate per their ad on page 43 of the PDF (source[5]). So probably exclude them unless there's overlap.\n\nService areas: Both companies serve Tampa Bay area according to sources[1][8]. Pricing details: Prestige mentions $175-$225/hour depending on service type (source[6]), while Conrad likely varies by item since they buy jewelry too.\n\nCertifications: ISA memberships for both companies' staffs where applicable (Erika at Prestige is ISA certified). Ron Conrad’s certifications aren't specified beyond experience years noted in source[1].\n\nBusiness hours: Both operate by appointment only according to sources[1][6].\n\nNeed to structure this into sections per query requirements:\n\nOverview first highlighting key players then list each with details as per points required.\n</think>\n\n## Overview of Antique Appraisal Services in Tampa  \nTampa hosts several reputable antique appraisal firms offering specialized services for jewelry, fine art, furniture, collectibles, insurance claims/coverage**,** estate planning**,** tax assessments**,** liquidation advice**,** IRS-compliant documentation**,** auction consulting**.
