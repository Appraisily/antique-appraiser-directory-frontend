Let me start by going through each source to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at [1], San Diego Gemological Laboratory is mentioned. They do appraisals for jewelry, watches, gemstones, etc., but not specifically antiques. Maybe they handle antique jewelry? The contact is Elliot Grunwald at (619) 286-6614. Founded in 1978, so years in business would be since then.\n\n[2] and [4] talk about Prestige Estate Services. They offer antique appraisals including furniture. Their team has ISA and ASA certifications. They offer in-person, remote, and photo valuations. Pricing isn't exact but varies by service type.\n\n[3] Thompson Fine Art Services specializes in Asian art and archaeology appraisals. USPAP compliant and offers services for insurance, estate tax, etc.\n\n[5] mentions Ellen Amirkhan as a Certified Appraiser of Oriental Rugs with ISA certification through ARCS events in Dallas but based on the info from Rug Care Specialists past events; however, her location isn't clear here—maybe she's based elsewhere?\n\n[6] again refers to Prestige Estate Services as local appraisers near San Diego with ISA/ASA certifications.\n\n[7] Diamonds Forever does jewelry appraisals including antiques but focuses more on jewelry than general antiques.\n\n[8] Antique Galleries of Palm Springs lists Paul Golubovs in San Diego for general appraisals (858-578-5540). Lynn Rabins handles Asian specialties but is in LA.\n\nPutting this together: The main antique appraisers in San Diego seem to be Prestige Estate Services (specializing broadly), Paul Golubovs (general), Thompson Fine Art (Asian art), SD Gemological Lab (jewelry/antique jewelry). Need to check if others like Ellen Amirkhan are local—maybe not directly stated here except Paul Golubovs via [8].\n\nService areas would primarily be San Diego metro unless noted otherwise like Lynn Rabins being LA-based but listed under Palm Springs' referrals?\n\nPricing: From [7], Diamonds Forever charges $160+ per item; others might have similar ranges or variable costs as mentioned by Prestige's varying fees based on complexity.\n</think>\n\nSan Diego offers specialized antique appraisal services through certified professionals covering diverse categories like furniture, fine art, Asian artifacts, rugs, and jewelry.
