      "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a detailed directory of antique appraisers in St. Paul, Minnesota based on the provided search results. Let me start by understanding the query requirements.\n\nFirst, the user wants an overview of antique appraisal services in St. Paul. Looking at the search results, Prestige Estate Services (source 1) is mentioned as having a nationwide network with IRS-qualified appraisers and USPAP compliance. They handle government assets but also mention expertise in antiques, fine art, and collectibles. Redtail Appraisals (source 2) has Rebekah Assid with ISA certification and specializes in antiques and decorative arts. Revere Auctions (source 3) offers authentication services in St. Paul and Minneapolis, which is part of appraisals but not full appraisals? Maybe include them as they are local.\n\nAppraiseItNow (source 5) operates online but mentions Minnesota locations; however, their process is mostly digital except for jewelry needing in-person checks. Anoka Antiques (source 6) lists David Schlueter as a certified appraiser serving Anoka area near St. Paul.\n\nHolly Nelson from ISA directory (source 9) is based in Braham, MN‚Äîabout an hour from St. Paul‚Äîso maybe include her under service areas covering nearby regions.\n\nNext step: list each appraiser with their details.\n\nFor Prestige Estate Services: Name would be the company name since individual names aren't listed here; specialties include antiques among others; contact info from source [1] might be generic since specific numbers aren't shown except \"contact our specialized government services division at [contact information]\"‚Äîmaybe omit or note to check website? Years in business not directly stated but copyright is 2024 so likely established earlier.\n\nRedtail Appraisals has Rebekah Assid's name mentioned explicitly with ISA certification; specialties are antiques and decorative arts; contact info includes phone number from source [2].\n\nRevere Auctions has Sean Blanchet and Robert Snell listed as owners/specialists but focus on authentication rather than full appraisal? Still relevant if they offer appraisal services too?\n\nAnoka Antiques' David Schlueter: certified appraiser with phone number provided via source [6].\n\nAppraiseItNow's Minnesota presence via source [5], though primarily online except for jewelry‚Äîmight mention under service areas that they operate statewide including St.Paul with some exceptions needing physical inspection.\n\nService areas: Need to clarify if these businesses serve St.Paul specifically or broader MN regions like Twin Cities metro area or statewide through networks like Prestige‚Äôs nationwide coverage but local teams available quickly per their description about rapid response teams across states including MN possibly?\n\nPricing info isn't explicit except AppraiseItNow starts at $195 for straightforward cases according to source [5]; others may require consultation so standard fees apply typically $150-$300/hour depending on complexity noted generally without specifics elsewhere perhaps inferred from industry standards?\n\nCertifications: USPAP compliance common among all legitimate ones like Prestige & Redtail‚Äôs ISA memberships plus IRS qualifications where applicable such as Prestige being IRS-qualified which matters for tax-related valuations etc., important for users needing official documentation purposes like donations or estate settlements requiring IRS acceptance of reports submitted by qualified professionals only!\n\nNotable certifications should highlight ISA CAPP certifications where present e.g., Holly Nelson from ISA directory entry shows she's CAPP certified working out Braham MN near enough perhaps included even though outside city limits given proximity within state boundaries allowing service coverage into SaintPaul metro region upon request maybe via travel arrangements made by firm itself when necessary especially urgent needs mentioned earlier regarding government contracts handled efficiently despite location differences due strategic positioning points covered under infrastructure supporting quick deployments noted earlier within sources cited here!\n\nBusiness hours need checking each site individually but since most don‚Äôt specify hours beyond contact numbers suggesting standard office times unless otherwise stated so defaulting ‚ÄúBy appointment‚Äù seems safe assumption unless data available says otherwise which none do here apart maybe Anoka Antique‚Äôs listing says call/text implying flexible scheduling options possible there too!\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOverview section should summarize key players emphasizing USPAP/ISA standards prevalent ensuring reliability across providers while highlighting range specializations available locally such fine art vs furniture etc., plus mention digital options versus traditional methods depending client preferences/circumstances involved when selecting suitable provider(s).\n\nList entries must capture each entity found through sources along respective details accurately parsed without making up info not present even if incomplete entries exist due lack data points certain aspects like exact years operation start dates missing entirely hence omitting those fields acceptable per user instructions keeping concise factual responses prioritized over speculative content generation beyond what evidence supports clearly!\n</think>\n\nSt. Paul hosts several reputable antique appraisal firms offering specialized expertise across various categories:\n\n---\n\n## **Key Providers**\n\n### **1\\.
