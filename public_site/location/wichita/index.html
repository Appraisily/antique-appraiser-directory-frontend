              <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">How do antique appraisals work in Wichita, Kansas?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most antique appraisers in Wichita, Kansas review condition, age, maker marks, materials, and comparable sales to estimate fair market value. A written report is often used for insurance, estates, donations, or resale.</p>
