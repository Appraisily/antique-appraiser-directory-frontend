              <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">How do antique appraisals work in Oakland, California?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most antique appraisers in Oakland, California review condition, age, maker marks, materials, and comparable sales to estimate fair market value. A written report is often used for insurance, estates, donations, or resale.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Bring clear photos (front/back/details/marks), measurements, condition notes, and any provenance (receipts, family history, restoration notes).</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Pricing varies by item type and scope (single item vs. estate). Many providers quote a flat fee or hourly rate; ask whether the fee includes a written report and research/comparables.</p>
