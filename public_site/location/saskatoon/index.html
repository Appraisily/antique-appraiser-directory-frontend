              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most antique appraisers in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan review condition, age, maker marks, materials, and comparable sales to estimate fair market value. A written report is often used for insurance, estates, donations, or resale.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Pricing varies by item type and scope (single item vs. estate). Many providers quote a flat fee or hourly rate; ask whether the fee includes a written report and research/comparables.</p>
